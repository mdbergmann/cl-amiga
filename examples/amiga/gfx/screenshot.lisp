;;; screenshot.lisp — save the front screen (or the Workbench) as an image.
;;;
;;; The photographer of the FS-UAE examples harness
;;; (verify/realamiga/screen-grab.lisp, which waits for windows to appear
;;; and shoots them unattended) as a program of its own: point it at a
;;; screen and it writes the pixels out as a binary PPM (P6), the plain
;;; RGB format every host tool reads (ffmpeg, ImageMagick, GIMP, a PPM
;;; datatype on the Amiga).
;;;
;;; Two kinds of screen, two ways to the pixels:
;;;
;;;   RTG screens (a CyberGraphX / Picasso96 / uaegfx / SAGA Workbench,
;;;   every MorphOS screen) keep their pixels in whatever chunky format
;;;   the graphics card likes; the portable way at them is the RTG
;;;   system's ReadPixelArray, which converts any RTG bitmap to 24-bit
;;;   RGB in one call.  cybergraphics.library's is the common API (both
;;;   CyberGraphX and Picasso96 provide it, MorphOS natively) with
;;;   p96ReadPixelArray of Picasso96API.library as the fallback.  Both
;;;   libraries are opened by the program itself and called by LVO
;;;   through AMIGA:CALL-LIBRARY: the generated amiga/raw/cybergraphics
;;;   module would open the library at load time and refuse to load on
;;;   an Amiga without it, and this program must run there too.
;;;
;;;   Native chipset screens (a custom LORES/HIRES screen, the Workbench
;;;   of an Amiga without a graphics card) are planar: one bit per pixel
;;;   per plane, in CHIP memory, and the ViewPort's ColorMap turns pen
;;;   numbers into colours.  The bitplanes are read straight out of the
;;;   BitMap with PEEK-BYTES -- a few hundred FFI calls for the whole
;;;   screen, not one ReadPixel per pixel -- and resolved through the
;;;   palette from GetRGB32.  Whether a screen is one or the other is
;;;   read off the BitMap's geometry (PLANAR-GEOMETRY-P).
;;;
;;; What it shows: LockPubScreen / UnlockPubScreen, the screen list
;;; under LockIBase (which screen is in front), struct Screen / BitMap /
;;; ColorMap through the generated raw accessors, PEEK-BYTES and
;;; POKE-BYTES between foreign memory and Lisp byte vectors, a DOS file
;;; written from a foreign buffer with no copy through the Lisp heap,
;;; and optional libraries opened by hand and called by LVO.
;;;
;;; Run on AmigaOS 3+ or MorphOS:
;;;   clamiga --load examples/amiga/gfx/screenshot.lisp
;;; It counts down three seconds so you can bring the screen you want
;;; to the front, then writes RAM:screenshot.ppm.  From the REPL,
;;; (screenshot:grab :screen :workbench :file "RAM:wb.ppm") shoots the
;;; default public screen without the countdown, and SCREEN-RGB hands
;;; you the pixels of any screen for your own purposes.  GRAB and RUN
;;; return a plist (:file :width :height :depth :method :bytes), :method
;;; being :CGX, :P96 or :BITPLANES.  amiga.intuition:*event-loop-timeout*
;;; (the unattended-run knob of the other examples) skips the countdown.
;;; Hardware sprites live in no bitmap, so the mouse pointer is never in
;;; the picture.
