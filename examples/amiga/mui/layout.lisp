;;; layout.lisp — the port of the MUI SDK's Layout.c: a *custom layout
;;; hook*.  A group hands its layout to a MUIA_Group_LayoutHook -- here a
;;; Lisp function -- which MUI calls twice for two different questions:
;;; MUILM_MINMAX ("how big do you want to be?", answered from the sizes
;;; the children already asked for) and MUILM_LAYOUT ("place your
;;; children"), where this one scatters them at random inside the
;;; rectangle it was given.  Any other lm_Type must be answered with
;;; MUILM_UNKNOWN.
;;;
;;; The game the C plays with them is here too: eight buttons whose
;;; MUIA_Pressed notification calls a second Lisp hook through
;;; MUIM_CallHook with the button's number; click them in order and a
;;; hidden ninth button appears (MUIA_ShowMe), click that to quit.  Get
;;; the order wrong and it beeps and starts over.  Overlapping objects
;;; are, as the C's own comment says, usually a bad idea -- a real layout
;;; hook is more sophisticated; this one shows the mechanism.
;;;
;;; What it shows: MUIA_Group_LayoutHook with an AMIGA.MUI:POOL-HOOK,
;;; LAYOUT-MSG-TYPE / LAYOUT-MSG-WIDTH / LAYOUT-MSG-HEIGHT and
;;; LAYOUT-MSG-MIN-MAX with SET-MIN-MAX, LAYOUT-CHILDREN (the
;;; NextObject() walk of lm_Children), AREA-MIN-WIDTH / AREA-MIN-HEIGHT
;;; (mui.h's _minwidth / _minheight), LAYOUT-CHILD (MUI_Layout),
;;; MUI_MAXMAX, MUIM_CallHook with a parameter, MUIA_ShowMe driven from a
;;; return ID.
;;;
;;; The hooks run inside MUI, on its stack: an error in one is caught at
;;; the callback, the hook returns 0, and the condition is re-signaled in
;;; Lisp when the MUI call that invoked it returns -- for the layout hook
;;; that is the SET-ATTRS that opens the window, for the press hook the
;;; APPLICATION-INPUT inside the event loop.
;;;
;;; Run on AmigaOS 3.x with MUI 3.8+ installed, or on MorphOS:
;;;   clamiga --load examples/amiga/mui/layout.lisp
;;; Unattended (auto-closes after 5 s):
;;;   clamiga --eval '(require "amiga/mui")' \
;;;           --eval '(setf amiga.mui:*event-loop-timeout* 5)' \
