;;; copyfile.lisp — double-buffered asynchronous file copy.
;;;
;;; Common Lisp port of the technique in the NDK 3.1 AsynchIO package
;;; (Examples1/AsynchIO/asyncio.c on the Amiga Developer CD): file I/O
;;; that talks DOS packets (ACTION_READ / ACTION_WRITE via PutMsg /
;;; WaitPort) straight to the filesystem handler, so the next buffer
;;; load is transferred by the filesystem WHILE the program processes
;;; the current one.  The packet machinery lives in AMIGA.ASYNCIO
;;; (lib/amiga/asyncio.lisp); this example uses it for what it was
;;; invented for — a fast file copy — and times the same copy done with
;;; plain synchronous CL streams next to it.
;;;
;;; What it shows: OPEN-ASYNC / WITH-ASYNC-FILE, bulk READ-ASYNC /
;;; WRITE-ASYNC through one foreign chunk buffer, WRITE-ASYNC straight
;;; from a Lisp byte vector, and READ-ASYNC verification of the result.
;;;
;;; Run on AmigaOS 3+ or MorphOS:
;;;   clamiga --load examples/amiga/asyncio/copyfile.lisp
