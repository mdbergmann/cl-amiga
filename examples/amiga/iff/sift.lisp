;;; sift.lisp — print the chunk structure of IFF files.
;;;
;;; Common Lisp port of the NDK 3.1 sift example (Examples2/IFF/other/
;;; sift.c on the Amiga Developer CD): parse any IFF file — or the
;;; clipboard, the C's -c switch — with ParseIFF in IFFPARSE_RAWSTEP
;;; mode and print an IFFCheck-like listing of every chunk, indented by
;;; nesting depth.  The parsing lives in AMIGA.IFF (lib/amiga/iff.lisp);
;;; (amiga.iff:sift "file") is the whole program.
;;;
;;; What it shows: the write side (WITH-IFF :WRITE, PUSH-CHUNK /
;;; WRITE-CHUNK-BYTES / POP-CHUNK with back-patched sizes) building a
;;; nested CAT-of-FORMs file, SIFT listing it, the read side
;;; (PARSE-STEP / CURRENT-CHUNK / READ-CHUNK-BYTES) recovering chunk
;;; data, and SIFT on the clipboard.
;;;
;;; Run on AmigaOS 3+ or MorphOS:
;;;   clamiga --load examples/amiga/iff/sift.lisp
;;; then sift your own files with (amiga.iff:sift "work:image.ilbm").
