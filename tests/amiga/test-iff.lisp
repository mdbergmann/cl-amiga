;;; test-iff.lisp — Amiga-side tests of lib/amiga/iff.lisp (AMIGA.IFF,
;;; the iffparse.library module grown from the NDK 3.1 sift example).
;;;
;;; Loaded from run-tests.lisp via (load ...) inside #+amigaos, like
;;; test-asyncio.lisp: CHECK comes from run-tests.lisp.  The fixture
;;; file is written byte by byte with plain CL streams — independent of
;;; AMIGA.IFF's own write side — so SIFT's exact output is pinned
;;; against known bytes; the write side is then proven by round-trip
;;; through the same independent SIFT, on a file and on the clipboard.
;;; The host mirror (tests/test_amiga_iff.sh) checks the pure-Lisp half
;;; and that everything loads and bows out where iffparse does not
;;; exist.
