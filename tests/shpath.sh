# Shared by the shell tests: spell a path the way the clamiga binary will.
#
# Under MSYS2 / Git Bash the shell and a NATIVE clamiga.exe disagree about
# paths.  The shell's "$(pwd)" is "/c/Users/you/cl-amiga" and its /tmp is a
# mount that clamiga.exe knows nothing about, while clamiga prints and resolves
# "C:/Users/you/cl-amiga".  Command-line arguments are converted automatically
# on the way to a native process, but a path compared against clamiga's OUTPUT,
# or handed over inside an environment variable or a generated .lisp file, is
# not — so a test that builds an expected string from $(pwd) compares two
# spellings of the same directory and fails.
#
# native_path prints the spelling clamiga uses (MSYS tools accept it too), and
# is the identity function on every other host.
