/* Compaction forwarding structures: size bound and correctness.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-24 the compactor forwarded through a table with one uint32
 * per CL_ALIGN granule of the used heap span — a transient off-heap block as
 * large as the heap itself on 32-bit.  An A1200 with its 8 MB heap in the
 * Zorro block could not AllocVec another 7-8 MB once the trapdoor Fast RAM
 * held the compiler pool and the stacks, so every compaction attempt failed
 * and fell back to a sweep, and every bump-exhausted allocation re-ran the
 * whole mark phase to fail again: test-amiga-lowend spent ~25 s per
 * allocation in the 'alloc sweep-forever escape' check.
 *
 * The compactor now derives forwarding addresses from a live-granule bitmap
 * plus a per-page slide cursor (mem.c, gc_compute_forwarding / gc_forward):
 * about 1/32 + 1/64 of the used span.  These tests pin the bound and check
 * that the derived addresses are right for a fragmented live set whose
 * objects range from a cons to many pages, across several compactions.  The
 * gc-stress build additionally cross-checks the lookup against the slide's
 * placement on every live object of every compaction (gc_slide).
 *
 * The last two tests cover the fallback for a block that cannot be had at
 * all (cl_gc_fwd_fail_over stands in for platform_alloc refusing it): the
 * compaction sweeps instead and says so once per episode, and while that
 * latch is set an allocation that only a deep free-list block can satisfy
 * takes it instead of re-running a doomed compaction.  The exit-time leak
 * check for the same scenario lives in tests/test_memleak_tracked.sh. */
