# FINISH-OUTPUT / FORCE-OUTPUT must reach the OS through every stream
# DESIGNATOR the standard allows (CLHS 21.1.1.1), not just through an explicit
# concrete-stream argument.
#
# Regression: the builtins were guarded by `n > 0 && CL_STREAM_P(args[0])` and
# then dispatched on the argument's own stream_type, so
#
#   (finish-output)                   ; designator absent -> *STANDARD-OUTPUT*
#   (finish-output t)                 ; -> *TERMINAL-IO*, a two-way wrapper
#   (finish-output <synonym stream>)
#   (finish-output <two-way stream>)
#
# every one of them flushed nothing at all — silently, returning NIL as if it
# had.  Only an explicit file/socket/broadcast stream ever reached the platform
# layer.  That is the shape of bug an unattended batch run pays for: a harness
# that dutifully flushes its log after each step is writing into a buffer it
# never empties, and when the process dies the tail of the log is not where it
# died.
#
# The probe: a file stream carries a userland write buffer (4K IOBuf on
# AmigaOS, stdio's on the host), and is opened here in append/shared mode so a
# second, independent input stream may read the file while the writer is still
# open.  The payload can only be seen there if the flush actually happened.
# Order matters: read back BEFORE closing, since CLOSE flushes too and would
# hide the bug; the close afterwards is only cleanup.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_finish_output_flush.sh build/host/clamiga
