# Regression test: concurrent JOIN-THREAD of the same worker must not
# double-join / double-free, and ALL-THREADS / THREAD-ALIVE-P must not
# dereference a worker freed concurrently by the zombie reaper.
#
# Pre-fix bi_join_thread had no mutual exclusion: two joiners both read
# the same CL_Thread from cl_thread_table, both called
# platform_thread_join on the same handle (double pthread_join — UB and
# a double free of the AmigaThread/pthread wrapper), and both called
# cl_thread_free_worker(t) — the "pointer being freed was not
# allocated" crash.  The zombie reaper in MAKE-THREAD could also free a
# finished worker while a joiner was still parked inside
# platform_thread_join on its handle.
#
# The scenario spawns a short-lived worker plus TWO joiners racing to
# join it, while a churn loop creates/finishes workers to keep the
# reaper active and a poller hammers ALL-THREADS / THREAD-ALIVE-P.
# Reproduction is probabilistic per run, so the binary runs several
# times; any crash / hang / double-free abort in ANY run fails.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_join_race.sh build/host/clamiga
