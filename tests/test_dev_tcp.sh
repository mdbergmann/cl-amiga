# Executable specification for EXT.DEV.TCP -- the development port over TCP
# (lib/dev-tcp.lisp): the transport the host Clamacs talks to, and the one
# a Mac Clamacs drives an Amiga clamiga with over the LAN.
#
# The command layer behind it is tests/test_dev_commands.sh's business; what
# is checked here is the port: the frames, the AUTH gate and the three rules
# of "Who may connect" (clamacs/specs/clamacs-host.md) -- loopback unless
# :host names one address, a token always, drawn from the OS or given --
# and the REPL's way back over a `tcp:HOST:PORT/TOKEN' name.
#
# Also run by the gc-stress suite (`make test-gc-stress', CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1):
# there only the compact "allocating paths" section runs, since the others
# lean on wall-clock timeouts that a compaction on every allocation stretches.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_dev_tcp.sh build/host/clamiga
