# Regression test: the outbuf-table mutex (cl_stream_table_mutex) must not be
# leaked locked when the thread count changes mid-critical-section.
#
# The bug: cl_stream_alloc_outbuf / cl_stream_free_outbuf / cl_make_cbuf_input_stream
# (and the FASL active-object registries) gated BOTH the mutex lock and its
# matching unlock on `CL_MT()` == `cl_thread_count > 1`, evaluated live at each
# site.  A thread that locked the table while a peer worker was alive (CL_MT
# true) and then reached its unlock AFTER that worker exited/joined — dropping
# the count to 1 — saw CL_MT() == false and SKIPPED the unlock.  The mutex was
# then held forever with no owner, so the very next FORMAT / string-output-stream
# creation (which also FORMATs) deadlocked both threads in platform_mutex_lock.
#
# The fix captures the multithread decision ONCE per function (`int mt = CL_MT()`,
# mirroring mem.c's `int multi` idiom) so lock and unlock always agree.
#
# Repro: the main thread FORMATs in a tight loop (each FORMAT locks the outbuf
# table) while short-lived workers repeatedly flip the thread count 2<->1.  This
# lands the count-drop inside a locked critical section almost every run, so the
# buggy build hangs deterministically; the fixed build always prints the marker.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_stream_mutex_leak.sh build/host/clamiga
