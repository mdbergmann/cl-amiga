# Regression test: concurrent MP:MAKE-THREAD + EXT:GC-COMPACT at high thread
# count must not hang, corrupt, or crash.  Guards a cluster of thread-vs-moving-
# GC bugs that only surface once several worker threads compact the heap at the
# same time (baseline hangs at 6 workers, which masked the corruption below):
#
#  1. Stop-the-world newborn hang: MAKE-THREAD registered the child in
#     cl_thread_list BEFORE its OS thread existed, so a peer STW that began in
#     that window waited forever for a thread that could never reach a
#     safepoint.  Fix: gc_live flag + cl_gc_thread_online barrier; the STW wait
#     loop only waits for `gc_live` threads.
#
#  2. child->result double-forward: MAKE-THREAD registered
#     gc_roots[0]=&child->result, which aliases the t->result thread-metadata
#     slot that gc_update_thread_roots also forwards.  gc_forward() is not
#     idempotent, so the closure offset was relocated twice → the worker applied
#     a wrong-typed object ("Not a function: heap object type N").
#
#  3. Stale `func` C-local: thread_entry read func=t->result at entry, then the
#     abort-restart setup allocated (compaction possible); the C-local was not
#     forwarded, so cl_vm_apply ran a stale closure offset.  Fix: re-read func
#     from the forwarded t->result just before the apply.
#
#  4. JOIN-THREAD stale tobj double-free: bi_join_thread cached
#     tobj=OBJ_TO_PTR(arg) before cl_gc_leave_safe_region(), which can park the
#     caller across a peer compaction that relocates the wrapper.  The stale
#     pointer left cl_thread_table[id] pointing at the freed worker, so
#     gc_finalize_dead freed it again ("pointer being freed was not allocated").
#     Fix: re-derive tobj after the safe region.
#
#  5. Heap-result staleness: a worker's return value lived only in t->result,
#     but the worker unregisters before JOIN reads it, so a peer compaction
#     swept/relocated the result — JOIN returned garbage.  Fix: publish the
#     result into the GC-managed wrapper (CL_ThreadObj.result), which stays
#     marked+forwarded until JOIN reads it.
#
# Reproduction is probabilistic per run, so each scenario runs several times;
# any hang (timeout), crash (non-zero exit), or missing DONE marker fails.
#
