# Deep/wide form compilation and the C-stack guard (reader + compiler).
#
# Regression for the 2026-07-16 Amiga silent-corruption bug: source-loading
# a deeply nested macro tower (lambda-tale amiga-ui.lisp) at a small shell
# stack overflowed the C stack inside READ_EXPR recursion — the compiler's
# stack guard never fired because the reader had no check at all, and the
# per-recursion-level frames were huge (read_expr carried a 4KB #* scan
# buffer; compile_and/or/cond/case/typecase carried 2-4KB patch arrays).
#
# Fixes under test:
#   1. Pending-jump chains threaded through the bytecode replaced the
#      per-frame patch arrays — this also removed the 512-clause cap, so
#      wide AND/OR/COND/CASE/ECASE must now compile and run correctly.
#   2. Nested chains: each nesting level keeps an independent chain head —
#      a 300-deep COND tower must compile correctly.
#   3. read_expr calls cl_check_c_stack: a pathologically deep form must
#      signal a clean, catchable error (never crash or corrupt), and the
#      session must remain usable afterwards.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_stack_depth.sh build/host/clamiga
