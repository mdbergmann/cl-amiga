# Regression test for off-heap (non-arena) memory that was never handed back.
#
# clamiga keeps a lot of memory outside the GC arena: every compiled function
# owns a bytecode body, a constants pool, &key arrays, a line map and (on
# m68k) JIT code; the compiler pool holds eight ~366 KB blocks; the struct,
# condition and setf/deftype indexes are hash tables; the stream layer has
# segmented directories.  None of it is visible to ROOM, and none of it used
# to be released.
#
# On a host that was invisible — the kernel reclaims the address space.  On
# AmigaOS nothing reclaims it, so each run permanently cost the machine
# 3,743,160 bytes of Fast RAM (measured with `Avail` on a Vampire before and
# after; the leak reproduced exactly, run after run, and was independent of
# --heap, which is what proved it was not the arena).
#
# Two separate defects, both covered here:
#   1. the GC swept dead bytecode objects without freeing their off-heap
#      buffers, so the leak also grew *during* a run (function redefinition,
#      COMPILE, reloading a file);
#   2. shutdown freed the arena but nothing hanging off it, so the entire
#      live boot image leaked at exit.
#
# The strong form of this test (every byte accounted for) needs the leak
# tracer: `make test-memleak`.  What runs here works in an ordinary build.
#
# Also runs under the gc-stress binary (make test-gc-stress, CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1)
# so the churn scenario's coalesce/finalize interaction (bytecode_release_offheap
# invoked from gc_finalize_dead) is exercised under forced compaction, not just
# whatever compaction pattern an ordinary run happens to trigger.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_shutdown_leak.sh build/host/clamiga

# --- 3. Source paths survive the FASL round-trip ---------------------------
#
# The FASL reader used to platform_alloc a fresh copy of the source path for
# every bytecode it read instead of interning it, so loading boot.fasl and
# clos.fasl alone left ~1400 duplicates of two strings (~104 KB) that nothing
# ever freed.  The fix routes the path through cl_intern_source_file, the
# same pool the compiler and image restore use — which also means the reader
# no longer owns the buffer it read into.
#
# The byte-level proof that the duplicates are gone is `make test-memleak`.
# What this guards is the behaviour that fix could have broken: a function
# loaded FROM A FASL must still report the file it was compiled from, and
# must report the same one as its neighbours in that file.
