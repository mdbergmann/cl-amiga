# Regression test: re-LOADing lib/gray-streams.lisp must stay idempotent.
#
# Bug: gray-streams.lisp installs its CL-I/O integration inside a top-level
# (LET ((orig-close (symbol-function 'close)) ...) ...).  Boot already loads
# the file once, and lib/quicklisp-compat.lisp LOADs it again unconditionally
# (and any library pulling trivial-gray-streams can trigger yet another LOAD).
# On the second LOAD every ORIG-X captured (SYMBOL-FUNCTION 'X) when X was
# ALREADY the gray-overridden generic function — so e.g. ORIG-CLOSE became the
# CLOSE GF itself.  The (STREAM T) method's (FUNCALL ORIG-CLOSE STREAM) then
# re-dispatched CLOSE on the same class, recursing forever:
#   %GF-DISPATCH-CACHED -> apply EMF -> orig-close -> CLOSE GF -> ... overflow
# This surfaced as a "%GF-DISPATCH-CACHED" VM frame stack overflow while
# quickloading (closing an ordinary file stream during ql:quickload :sento).
#
# The fix guards the integration LET with a one-shot symbol-plist marker so it
# installs exactly once per image; subsequent LOADs are a no-op.
#
# This test LOADs gray-streams.lisp a second time, then exercises CLOSE,
# READ-CHAR and WRITE-CHAR on ordinary streams.  Before the fix the CLOSE call
# overflowed the VM frame stack (non-zero exit / no DONE marker); after the fix
# it completes cleanly.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_gray_streams_reload.sh build/host/clamiga

CLAMIGA="${1:-build/host/clamiga}"

# Paths written into the generated .lisp file must be in clamiga's own
# spelling: under MSYS2 "$(pwd)" is /c/... but a native clamiga.exe resolves
# that against the current drive as C:/c/... and the LOAD fails.  (Before
# this, LOAD's per-form recovery swallowed that error on Windows and the test
# still printed its DONE marker — see the ERROR: check below.)
