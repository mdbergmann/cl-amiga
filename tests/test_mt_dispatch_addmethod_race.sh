# Regression test: concurrent (re)definition of a method must not make a
# peer thread's dispatch of the SAME generic function spuriously signal
# "No applicable method" for a method that plainly exists.
#
# Root cause this guards (lib/clos.lisp %install-method-in-gf): the method
# list was updated in TWO stores — first store the old list minus any method
# it replaces, THEN cons the new method on:
#
#     (%set-gf-methods gf (remove-if ...replaced... (gf-methods gf)))  ; A
#     (%set-gf-methods gf (cons method (gf-methods gf)))               ; B
#
# Between A and B, GF-METHODS transiently EXCLUDED the method being
# (re)defined.  A dispatcher on another thread that walked the list in that
# window computed an empty applicable-method set and wrongly signalled
# "No applicable method".  This is the multi-threaded race behind the ASDF
# field reports "No applicable method for ACTION-STATUS with args of types
# (NULL LOAD-OP SYSTEM)" during (asdf:load-system :chipi/tests): worker /
# watcher threads (log4cl, sento) dispatch GFs while the main thread
# (re)defines methods.
#
# Fix: update the method list with a SINGLE atomic %set-gf-methods store
# (new method consed onto the filtered old list), so a concurrent reader
# always observes a COMPLETE method list — either the old set or the new
# set, both of which contain every applicable method.
#
# The single-threaded REPL never hit this: it only mutates the method list
# at its own defmethod points, with no peer reading in between.  The scenario
# below runs several dispatcher threads calling a null-specialized 3-arg GF
# (mirroring ACTION-STATUS's ((plan null) (o operation) (c component)) method)
# while redefiner threads repeatedly redefine that exact method.  Before the
# fix thousands of dispatches per run wrongly error; after it every run
# reports zero failures and a genuine no-applicable-method still errors.
#
# SECOND root cause this guards (weak memory ordering, arm64 hosts): even
# with the single atomic list store, the CPU may make that publishing store
# visible to a peer core BEFORE the stores that initialized the freshly-built
# cons cell / method struct it points to (arm64 permits store-store
# reordering; x86 TSO does not).  A lock-free dispatcher walking the list in
# that nanosecond window read garbage — observed as a once-per-tens-of-
# millions "%STRUCT-REF: argument is not of type STRUCTURE" dispatch error,
# and (via the same unordered publication of a fresh dispatch-cache hash
# table) as a rare hang in the writer-writer phase below.  Fix: OP_STRUCT_SET
# / %STRUCT-SET / %STRUCT-SLOT-STORE issue a memory barrier before the slot
# store when threads are live, ordering initialization before publication
# (vm.c / builtins_struct.c; free on single-core m68k).  The dispatcher
# handlers below capture the actual condition text so any recurrence is
# diagnosable straight from the test output.
