# Interactive debugger backtrace: `:bt [n|all]`, a growable buffer, and frames
# that survive evaluation at the Debug> prompt.
#
# All three legs are about one complaint: the debugger printed 20 frames and a
# "... N more frames" tail with no way to see the rest.
#
#   1. `:bt all` / `:bt N` re-render the ERROR-TIME frames at a chosen depth,
#      so the frames behind that tail become reachable.  Plain `:bt` keeps the
#      default window.  A bad argument explains itself instead of being
#      evaluated as Lisp.
#
#   2. The formatted text grows onto the C heap.  With ~40 frames carrying long
#      source paths, `:bt all` is well over the old fixed 2048-byte ceiling —
#      which used to cut the text off mid-frame, a second invisible limit
#      stacked on top of the frame limit.
#
#   3. (ext:backtrace) at the Debug> prompt reports the error-time stack.  The
#      mini-REPL used to zero cl_vm.sp/fp before evaluating, destroying the very
#      frames the user entered the debugger to inspect: (ext:backtrace) returned
#      its own single frame, and :bt N had nothing left to re-render.
