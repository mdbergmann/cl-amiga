# Regression tests for the Tier-4 Phase 1 runtime-tax removals
# (specs/performance.md 4.1).  Each case pins the BEHAVIOUR that a
# performance change had to preserve, so a later optimization in the same
# area cannot quietly trade correctness for speed.
#
#   sh tests/test_tier4_phase1.sh build/host/clamiga
#
# Covered:
#   1. call_builtin no longer copies the multiple-value buffer on every
#      call — THROW must still see its value form's extra values.
#   2. call_builtin no longer runs cl_check_c_stack — deep recursion must
#      still end in a catchable error, not a crash.
#   3. TYPEP dispatches standard type names by a code on the symbol — every
#      name must answer exactly as the strcmp cascade did, including for a
#      same-named symbol that is NOT the COMMON-LISP one.
#   4. The per-thread slot-index cache must be invalidated by class
#      redefinition (a warmed cache must not serve a stale slot index).
#   5. The GF inline cache validates by class NAME instead of a
#      *CLASS-TABLE* lookup — dispatch must stay correct across receiver
#      classes, subclasses and method redefinition.
#   6. OP_CONS / OP_LIST / &rest build their lists from GC-rooted stack
#      slots — the results must be well formed at every arity.
