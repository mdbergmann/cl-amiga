# Regression test: FILE-POSITION on a Gray-stream instance must answer NIL
# ("position cannot be determined", CLHS), not signal an error.
#
# Bug: the C builtin FILE-POSITION rejects anything that is not a builtin
# CL_Stream with "FILE-POSITION: not a stream" — and a Gray stream is a CLOS
# instance.  The gray shim (lib/gray-streams.lisp) redefines the stream API
# but did not cover FILE-POSITION, so flexi-streams' MAYBE-REWIND probe —
# which calls (FILE-POSITION stream) on the underlying chunga stream inside
# its character-decoding READ-SEQUENCE path and expects NIL from
# non-positionable streams — crashed instead.  Net effect: every drakma
# response that was chunked + text + no content-length failed, on every
# transport (plain HTTP and HTTPS alike).
#
# The fix routes Gray instances to the trivial-gray-streams
# STREAM-FILE-POSITION protocol when that system is loaded and answers NIL
# otherwise (both directions: query and set); non-Gray streams keep the
# original C builtin.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_gray_file_position.sh build/host/clamiga
