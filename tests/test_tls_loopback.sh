# TLS end-to-end test: drives tests/tls-loopback.lisp — an MP server thread
# and the main thread handshake with each other over loopback through the
# native TLS layer (EXT:SOCKET-START-TLS), exchanging characters and binary
# data, checking LISTEN semantics, peer-certificate introspection,
# certificate-verification success AND failure, and EOF delivery.
#
# The Lisp script prints "TLS-LOOPBACK ALL-PASSED" only when every check
# passed; it also prints it when no TLS provider is installed on the host
# (the whole feature is runtime-optional), so this test never fails just
# because OpenSSL is missing.
#
# Also run by the gc-stress suite (CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1) so the TLS builtins'
# allocating paths (string args, peer-cert plist) see forced compaction.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_tls_loopback.sh build/host/clamiga
