# Process exit on AmigaOS stops workers that are still RUNNING.
#
# Nothing ends a worker task on AmigaOS: one still running when main returns
# executes the unloaded program code and crashes.  main() therefore asks
# every worker to unwind (the DESTROY-THREAD path, cl_thread_stop_workers)
# before it tears anything down; the host keeps its _exit, so the mechanism
# is tested here through MP::%STOP-WORKERS:
#   - a busy loop, a condition wait, a SLEEP and a lock wait all unwind,
#     running their UNWIND-PROTECT cleanups, and leave the registry;
#   - a worker blocked in foreign code (libc sleep) never reaches a
#     safepoint: the call gives up at its bound and counts it as left;
#   - no workers: returns 0 at once; a bad timeout is a TYPE-ERROR.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_stop_workers.sh build/host/clamiga
