# The call generation word from Lisp: (clamiga::%call-gen) must move across
# every event that could leave a m68k JIT call site with a stale cached
# callee (specs/jit-direct-calls.md §1) -- each public way of changing a
# function cell (DEFUN from source and from a FASL, (SETF FDEFINITION),
# (SETF SYMBOL-FUNCTION), FMAKUNBOUND, a SETF function), every collection,
# TRACE/UNTRACE, and the thread events a looping caller must notice
# (MP:INTERRUPT-THREAD, MP:DESTROY-THREAD) -- and must NOT move on a plain
# call, since nothing on the per-call path may write shared memory.
# tests/test_call_gen.c pins the exact counts at the C level.
#
# Also run by `make test-gc-stress` (CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1: compaction on
# every allocation, so every allocating form bumps -- the checks below
# assert "moved", which a stress run must still satisfy, and the no-bump
# check uses a call loop that does not allocate).
# Run: sh tests/test_call_gen.sh [path-to-clamiga]
