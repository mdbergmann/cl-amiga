# Regression test: concurrent slow-path dispatch-cache updates must not corrupt
# a generic function's dispatch-cache hash table.
#
# Root cause this guards (lib/clos.lisp %make-dispatch-cache +
# builtins_hashtable.c CL_HT_FLAG_SYNC): a generic function's dispatch cache is
# a hash table that peer threads read AND write concurrently — the main thread
# loading a system while worker / watcher threads (sento, log4cl) dispatch the
# same GF.  The cache is only consulted on the slow (cache-miss) path; the
# monomorphic inline-cache fast path never touches it.  Previously that table
# was a plain lock-free hash table: two threads splicing new entries onto the
# same bucket — or one thread rehashing (relinking every cell into a doubled
# bucket vector and swapping bucket_vec/bucket_count) while another walks it —
# could cross-link the chains, which crashes rarely under contention with wild
# out-of-bounds bucket reads.
#
# Fix: dispatch caches are now created with %MAKE-SYNC-HASH-TABLE, whose
# GETHASH / (SETF GETHASH) / REMHASH / CLRHASH serialize on a global mutex so a
# concurrent reader never observes a half-applied splice or rehash.  All
# consing / bucket-vector growth happens BEFORE the lock, so the critical
# section is allocation-free (never parks at a GC safepoint holding the lock)
# and the monomorphic fast path stays completely lock-free.
#
# The scenario below hammers ONE polymorphic generic function from many threads
# over MANY argument classes at once, starting from an empty cache each round
# (a fresh GF per round) so the empty->filled->rehashed transitions — the exact
# window where two threads splice/grow the same table — happen repeatedly and
# simultaneously.  A cross-linked or half-swapped table shows up as a crash
# (non-zero exit) or a wrong / errored dispatch result.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_dispatch_cache_race.sh build/host/clamiga
