# Regression tests for COMPILE-FILE reader-package handling.
#
# During COMPILE-FILE the reader interns each form's symbols using the package
# established by the file's IN-PACKAGE forms.  A compile-time evaluation can
# transiently rebind *PACKAGE* (e.g. ASDF's session/visiting machinery unwinds
# dynamic *PACKAGE* bindings during the operate that drives compile-file), and
# that must NOT switch the reader to the wrong package mid-file.  If it does, a
# later form's symbols intern in the wrong package, producing a *different*
# symbol object than the file's earlier forms registered — observed in
# esrap/expressions.lisp as EXPRESSION-CASE interning in COMMON-LISP-USER and
# the compiler error "FUNCTION: OUTPUT is not a valid function name".
#
# COMPILE-FILE preserves the reader package across each top-level form, except
# IN-PACKAGE (including IN-PACKAGE nested in PROGN/EVAL-WHEN/LOCALLY/MACROLET),
# whose change must persist.
#
# Run fresh clamiga per case (a cold heap) so this exercises the compile path
# directly without the accumulated-heap slowdown of the C test harness.
# Run: sh tests/test_compile_file_package.sh [path-to-clamiga]
