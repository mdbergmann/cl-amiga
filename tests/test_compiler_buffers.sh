# Regression tests for the compiler's growable working buffers.
#
# A CL_Compiler used to hold its bytecode and constants as fixed arrays at the
# hard limits (262144 bytes, 8192 entries): 366 KB per block, and the compiler
# pool pre-warms eight blocks, so every clamiga process carried 3 MB of
# off-heap memory before its first form.  The buffers now start small, grow
# on demand up to the same limits, and a pooled block keeps them between
# compiles unless one compile grew them past the keep size.
#
#   sh tests/test_compiler_buffers.sh build/host/clamiga
#
# Covered:
#   1. The pool at rest: eight blocks, each a fraction of the old size
#      (EXT:%COMPILER-POOL-STATS), and no parked buffer above the keep
#      size after any of the compiles below.
#   2. Bytecode growth: functions past the initial buffer, past the keep
#      size and near the limit compile to the right code; a nested lambda
#      grows its own buffer while its parent's is grown too; oversized
#      buffers are not kept by the pool.
#   3. The limit: a function past 262144 bytes signals a clean error that
#      names the limit, from the top level and from a nested lambda, and the
#      pool gets every block back.
#   4. Constants growth: character and string constants past the initial
#      table and past the keep size come back EQL / EQ to the source objects
#      (under CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS the strings move on every allocation, so the
#      grown table must be what the collector forwards); past 8192 a clean
#      error, and the pool gets its blocks back.
#   5. Several threads compiling large functions at once.
#   6. COMPILE-FILE of a large function, loaded into a fresh process.
#
# Also run under the gc-stress binary (make test-gc-stress).
