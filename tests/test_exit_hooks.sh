# End-to-end tests for EXT:*EXIT-HOOKS* — hooks must run on EVERY way clamiga
# leaves the process, because (QUIT) unwinds via CL_ERR_EXIT and deliberately
# skips UNWIND-PROTECT cleanups: exit hooks are the only place user code gets
# to observe shutdown.
#
# Covered exit paths (all four reach the `shutdown:` funnel in main.c):
#   --non-interactive falling off the end of its --eval/--load actions
#   (QUIT n) from a --eval, with the exit code preserved
#   --script running to the end of the file
#   the batch REPL hitting EOF on stdin
#
# Plus the properties that make hooks usable at shutdown: they run
# most-recently-added first, streams still work (a hook can write a file), and
# a hook that errors is reported without taking the process or the remaining
# hooks down with it.
#
# The in-process unit tests are tests/test_exit_hooks.c.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_exit_hooks.sh build/host/clamiga
