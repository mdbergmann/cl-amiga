# Regression test (GC audit tier 4, batch 6, T2): concurrent interning of
# FRESH symbols (plus defmacro/deftype registrations) across threads must
# not hang.
#
# Pre-fix, the intern slow path allocated the bucket cons while HOLDING
# cl_package_rwlock's write lock (and the definition registrars consed
# under cl_tables_wrlock).  Under MT that allocation can trigger a
# stop-the-world GC which waits for every peer thread to park — but a
# peer blocked on the rdlock (any intern fast path) is not in a safe
# region and can never park: a circular STW-vs-rwlock wait, seen in the
# field as "random MT hangs under load".  The fix pre-conses every cell
# outside the locks and links with plain stores inside them.
#
# Reproduction is scheduler-dependent, so the binary runs several times
# under a hard timeout; any hang/crash in ANY run fails.
#
# When CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1 is already set in the environment (used by
# `make test-gc-stress`, which runs this script a second time against a
# -DDEBUG_GC_STRESS binary — see Makefile), every allocation forces a
# compacting GC, so instead of relying on scheduler luck to land a
# compaction inside the pre-cons-then-locked-link window, it happens on
# EVERY call.  That run also exercises SHADOW and EXPORT (cl_shadow_symbol
# / cl_export_symbol in package.c), the other two pre-cons-then-relink
# sites named in the audit alongside cl_intern_in and
# cl_table_prepend_locked (defmacro/deftype).  Iteration counts are cut
# down for that run because every single allocation now triggers a full
# mark-sweep-compaction.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_intern_stw.sh build/host/clamiga
# Run under stress: CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1 sh tests/test_mt_intern_stw.sh build/host-gcstress/clamiga
