/*
 * Tests for the conservative m68k-stack scanner used by the JIT.
 * Even though the scanner is a no-op on host (no JIT_M68K builds
 * codegen_m68k.c), the surrounding machinery — jit_depth,
 * jit_stack_top, cl_jit_active_threads, the conservative scan in
 * gc_mark_thread_roots, the compaction inhibit — is compiled on
 * host and exercised here.
 *
 * To make the test independent of compiler optimization (which might
 * keep a CL_Obj local in a register and never spill it), we place
 * the offset in a `volatile` array whose address bounds the scan
 * window.  That forces the value to be observable in memory at GC
 * time, exactly like a JIT-spilled operand.
 *
 * The moving compactor PINS conservatively-referenced objects (they keep
 * their offset) rather than rewriting the C stack, so the JIT's spilled
 * pointers stay valid and coincidental-integer C-stack words are never
 * mis-rewritten.  See specs/native-backend.md §"GC interaction" option B.
