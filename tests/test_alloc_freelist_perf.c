/* Regression test for the O(n^2) free-list allocation hang.
 *
 * Symptom: loading chipi (via quicklisp) wedged at 100% CPU right after
 * "Done compiling eisel-lemire.lisp".  jzon's eisel-lemire builds a 696-entry
 * power-of-ten table at FASL *load* time, doing millions of bignum
 * allocations.  On a fresh heap this is fast; under the full chipi heap it
 * hung forever.
 *
 * Root cause (mem.c):
 *   - alloc_from_free_list is first-fit and O(list length).
 *   - A sweep-only cl_gc() never resets the bump pointer, so once the arena
 *     high-water mark is reached (which the chipi compile easily does), every
 *     allocation is served from the free list.
 *   - When the free list is long AND fragmented (many small blocks in front of
 *     a block large enough to satisfy the request), each allocation walks past
 *     all the small blocks — O(n) per allocation, O(n^2) for the workload.
 *   - Compaction (which resets the bump pointer and clears fragmentation) only
 *     triggered when the free-list walk *fully failed*; here it always found a
 *     fit deep in the list, so compaction never fired and the walk never ended.
 *
 * Fix: cl_alloc probes only CL_FREELIST_PROBE_LIMIT blocks on the fast path; if
 * no fit turns up it compacts (resetting the bump pointer) instead of walking
 * the whole list.  A single unbounded walk remains as the last resort before
 * declaring the heap exhausted, so a genuine deep fit is never missed.
 *
 * This test rebuilds exactly that pathological heap shape and asserts the
 * total free-list walk stays bounded.  Without the fix the walk count explodes
 * to ~(allocations * free-list length); with it, it stays tiny because the
 * first miss compacts and restores the O(1) bump path.
