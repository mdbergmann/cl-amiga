# String-output-stream outbuf leak regressions, checked from Lisp via
# ext:%stream-outbuf-stats (used total).
#
# 1. Gray-streams printing fallbacks: princ/prin1/print/write/format/pprint
#    on a Gray stream capture through a temp string-output-stream.  That
#    temp must be CLOSEd (freeing its platform outbuf slot eagerly) — the
#    old code never closed it, leaking one slot per call until the next GC.
#    Under logging-heavy loads the leaked slots saturated the outbuf table
#    every ~200 printed nodes and (with the old fixed-size table) forced a
#    full stop-the-world GC per allocation — printing ran at GC speed
#    (eta-hab item-definition stalls, 60-470s per log event).
#
# 2. The outbuf table grows on demand past its 256-slot block: holding well
#    over one block's worth of simultaneously-open streams must work and
#    every stream's content must survive.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_stream_outbuf_leak.sh build/host/clamiga
