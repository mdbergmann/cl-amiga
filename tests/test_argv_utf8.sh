# Regression: non-ASCII arguments must survive the command line intact.
#
# Windows hands main() its arguments in the process's ANSI code page — the
# real command line is UTF-16, and the CRT converts it down, turning every
# character the ACP cannot represent into '?'.  clamiga reads argv as UTF-8
# (that is what it is on POSIX and AmigaOS), so `--eval` forms and `--load`
# paths holding non-ASCII arrived destroyed: the codepoints below came back as
# 63 63 (two question marks).  main.c rebuilds argv from the UTF-16 command
# line; this checks the whole path from the shell through to CHAR-CODE.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_argv_utf8.sh [path-to-clamiga]

# The expectation is those OCTETS, not the codepoints, and that is not a
# mistake: a C-string reader source (which is what --eval is) is byte
# oriented, so each octet becomes one character on every platform — only the
# file reader decodes UTF-8, because the decoding lives in the stream layer.
# That asymmetry is pre-existing and is not what this test is about.  What it
# guards is that the octets ARRIVE AT ALL: on Windows the CRT converted the
# UTF-16 command line down to the ANSI code page before main() saw it, and
# every octet came through as 63 ('?') — the argument destroyed beyond
# recovery rather than merely re-interpreted.
