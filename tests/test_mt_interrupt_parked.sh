# Regression test (GC audit tier 4, batch 6, I5/T5): interrupt/destroy
# delivery to PARKED threads, and process shutdown with live workers.
#
# Pre-fix, interrupts were delivered only at safepoints.  A target parked
# in MP:CONDITION-WAIT (never notified) or a blocking MP:ACQUIRE-LOCK
# never runs another safepoint, so MP:DESTROY-THREAD of such a thread was
# deferred FOREVER — the destroyer's JOIN-THREAD hung.  The fix:
#   1. condition-wait re-checks interrupt_pending after publishing its
#      wait registration and skips the park (spurious wakeup) if set;
#   2. the interrupt/destroy publisher acquires the target's wait mutex
#      and broadcasts its condvar, so the target either saw the flag
#      pre-park or is parked and receives the broadcast;
#   3. blocking acquire-lock is a trylock loop (yield-spin phase, then
#      parked on the shared lock-parking condvar) that checks
#      interrupt_pending each round; the publisher broadcasts the parking
#      cv and a timed backstop bounds delivery.
# T5: exiting the process while spinner workers are still running must
# not crash in teardown (gc_mutex/list-lock destroyed under live threads
# pre-fix; now deliberately leaked when workers remain).
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_interrupt_parked.sh build/host/clamiga
