# Backtrace source lines.
#
# The line a backtrace frame reports comes from the frame's saved ip and the
# bytecode's pc->line map.  Two things used to go wrong:
#
#   1. The innermost frame's ip was only saved when a BYTECODE callee was
#      pushed.  An error signalled by a builtin, an FFI stub or an
#      OP_AMIGA_CALL (no frame of their own) was therefore reported at the
#      line of the previous bytecode call -- the reaction clicktab example
#      died on line 135 and the message said line 134.  The VM now saves ip
#      before every builtin / stub / library call (OP_CALL, OP_APPLY,
#      OP_AMIGA_CALL).
#
#   2. A suspended caller's ip is the RESUME point, just past its call.  When
#      the next form's code starts right there -- (list (f) (g)) with (g) on
#      the following line -- the lookup landed on (g)'s line.  The lookup now
#      maps ip - 1, the last byte of the call instruction.
