# The REPL's continuation prompt is only printed when the REPL is actually
# about to wait for a human (issue #14, second report).
#
# A form typed line by line gets the prompt after each incomplete line:
#
#     COMMON-LISP-USER> "
#                     > "
#     "
#     "
#
# A pasted multi-line form (or one an editor sends whole) arrives in one
# burst; the terminal echoes all of it before the REPL has read the first
# line, so a prompt printed then lands AFTER the echo, glued to the value:
#
#     COMMON-LISP-USER> "
#     "
#                     > "      <- looked like part of the value
#     "
#
# The REPL now asks the platform whether the rest of the form is already
# pending (platform_tty_char_avail) and skips the prompt when it is, so a
# paste reads like it does in SBCL.  A terminal is needed for the echo and
# for the kernel's line-at-a-time delivery — driven with expect(1) on a
# PTY, skipped where expect isn't installed (Linux CI images, MSYS2).
#
# Run: sh tests/test_repl_paste.sh build/host/clamiga
