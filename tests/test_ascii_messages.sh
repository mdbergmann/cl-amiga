# Every string literal in the C sources and every string in the shipped
# Lisp library must be plain ASCII.
#
# Why: the messages reach the user on an AmigaOS console, in a MUI text
# object and in Clamacs's echo area, none of which speak UTF-8 -- an
# em-dash written as three UTF-8 bytes comes out as "â\200\224" or as a
# lone replacement glyph ("<number>  ? invoke restart by number" was the
# debugger's help text on the Amiga).  The ISO-8859-1 console has no
# em-dash or arrow at all, so a hyphen and "->" are what the source has to
# say.  Comments are free to use whatever they like: this checks literals
# only, with comments stripped first.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_ascii_messages.sh        (no clamiga binary needed)

# C: drop /* */ and // comments, then report every "..." literal that holds
# a byte above 0x7F.  A `//' inside a string ("http://...") loses the rest
# of that line to the comment stripper, which only ever hides a literal --
# never flags a comment -- so the check stays one-sided and safe.
