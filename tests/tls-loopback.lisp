;;; tls-loopback.lisp — end-to-end TLS test over loopback.
;;;
;;; Exercises the whole EXT TLS surface against itself: an MP server thread
;;; accepts on an ephemeral loopback port and upgrades with :SERVER T; the
;;; main thread connects, upgrades as a client, and the two sides exchange
;;; data through the encrypted stream — characters, binary chunks, LISTEN,
;;; peer-certificate introspection, verification success AND failure, and
;;; EOF on close.  Driven by tests/test_tls_loopback.sh (and, under
;;; CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1, by the gc-stress suite); also runnable directly:
;;;
;;;   ./build/host/clamiga --non-interactive --load tests/tls-loopback.lisp
;;;
;;; Skips cleanly (still printing the ALL-PASSED marker) when no TLS
;;; provider is installed, so the suite stays green on hosts without
;;; OpenSSL — EXT:TLS-AVAILABLE-P is the honest gate.
