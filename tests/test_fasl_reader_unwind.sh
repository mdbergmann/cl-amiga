# A non-local exit out of a FASL load must take the loader's reader (and, for
# a source load's auto-cache, its writer) with it.
#
# fasl_load keeps its CL_FaslReader — a C stack local — registered as a GC
# root for the whole load, so forward GENSYM_REF/OBJ_REF targets survive a
# compaction.  An error caught by a C error frame restores the registry, but a
# Lisp HANDLER-CASE, RETURN-FROM or THROW leaves through the VM's NLX landing
# and passes no error frame: the registry kept pointing into dead stack, and
# the next GC marked whatever lived there as a reader (SEGV in
# gc_mark_children at varying addresses) — plus 256 KB of off-heap table
# leaked per abandoned load.  The landing now calls cl_fasl_reader_unwind_to
# next to cl_compiler_unwind_to.
#
# bi_load's own auto-cache registers a second, heap-allocated CL_FaslWriter
# (fw) the same way, for the same reason (its gensym dedup table must survive
# compaction across the interleaved compile/eval/serialize of later forms).
# fw is platform_alloc'd rather than a stack local, so an abandoning longjmp
# does not dangle-pointer-crash it — but nothing else freed fw or its
# fasl_buf/unit_buf for that path either, so it (and both buffers) leaked
# forever and the writer stayed registered until the active-writer table
# filled.  The landing now calls cl_fasl_writer_unwind_to right alongside
# cl_fasl_reader_unwind_to (see the "writer" case below).
#
# A stale registry is made deterministic here through EXT:SAVE-IMAGE, which
# refuses to run while any reader OR writer is registered.  The leak half
# lives in tests/test_memleak_tracked.sh, the compaction half in
# tests/test_gc_stress_regression.sh.

# --- 6. abandoned source LOADs give their source stream back ------------------
# LOAD and COMPILE-FILE read the file through a C-buffer stream, one of seven

# seventh caught LOAD error used to leave every later LOAD / COMPILE-FILE
# reading from NIL: nothing loaded, no file written, no error.  A dead stream
# now hands slot and file buffer back at the next collection, which a full
# table forces; LOADs that really nest deeper than the static block make the
# table grow (30 deep here: three blocks past the first; the FASL writer
# registry grows with it).  What does bound the nesting is the per-thread C
# error-frame stack, one frame per LOAD level: running out of it is a clear
# error from the level that hit it, and everything works afterwards.
