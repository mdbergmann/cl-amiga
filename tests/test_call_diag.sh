# The three call-site diagnostics say WHAT they got, not only that it was
# wrong: an arity error names the caller (file:line) and lists the
# arguments as received, "Not a function" describes the callee and the
# arguments, and a sequence builtin's keyword check names the builtin, the
# offending value, its position and the whole argument list.
#
# Why: on the Amiga an error read from a log is all there is (no debugger
# to ask for a backtrace), and the first symptom of a corrupted or shifted
# argument list IS one of these three errors -- "Too few arguments to
# PREFIX-P", "not a function", "keyword-argument key is not a symbol" with
# nothing else to go on (the Clamacs FASL finding of 2026-09-18).  The
# values tell a missing leading argument from a single bad one, and a
# non-object word prints as "#<raw ...>" / "#<out of arena ...>" instead
# of crashing the printer.
