# Regression test (GC audit tier 4, batch 6, T1): a thread wrapper whose
# table slot has been reaped and REUSED by an unrelated worker must not
# act on the new occupant.
#
# Pre-fix, cl_thread_table slots were keyed by index only.  When the
# table filled up, MAKE-THREAD's zombie reaper freed finished-but-
# unjoined workers and later MAKE-THREADs reused their slots.  A stale
# wrapper (thread_id = old index) then aliased the NEW occupant:
#   - THREAD-ALIVE-P reported the innocent occupant's liveness (T),
#   - INTERRUPT-THREAD / DESTROY-THREAD hit the innocent thread,
#   - JOIN-THREAD joined AND FREED the innocent worker (double free when
#     its own joiner finished).
# The fix adds a per-slot generation counter (cl_thread_table_gen);
# wrappers snapshot it at creation and every table lookup verifies it.
#
# The scenario is deterministic: CL_MAX_THREADS = 256.  A victim thread
# (lowest slot) finishes unjoined; 250 finished fillers (wrappers held so
# GC cannot release their slots) leave 4 free slots; 8 live spinners then
# force the table-full reaper, and spinner #5 reclaims the victim's slot.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_thread_identity.sh build/host/clamiga
