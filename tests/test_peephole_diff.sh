# Differential test for the bytecode peephole post-pass (spec 1.8).
#
# Runs tests/peephole-corpus.lisp with CLAMIGA_FORCE_SPEED=0 (pass disabled
# everywhere), =2 and =3 (pass forced on for every compile in the process)
# and requires byte-identical output.  A mis-relocated jump, broken NLX
# landing pad, or over-eager deletion shows up as a diff (or a crash).
#
# CLAMIGA_FORCE_SPEED pins the effective (optimize (speed N)) for the whole
# process, overriding declaim/declare — so ANY corpus works unmodified;
# growing test coverage automatically grows peephole coverage.
#
#   sh tests/test_peephole_diff.sh build/host/clamiga
#
# Also runs under the gc-stress binary (make test-gc-stress) to exercise the
# speed-3 compile path under forced compaction.
