# Regression: a file whose name is not representable in the platform's legacy
# 8-bit code page must still be created, listed by DIRECTORY, and reopened.
#
# On Windows this exercises the wide Win32 entry points in platform_win32.c.
# The ANSI ones (FindFirstFileA & co.) substitute '?' for every character the
# process code page cannot spell, so DIRECTORY used to hand back "???.lisp" —
# a name that matches no file and opens nothing, with no error anywhere.  The
# CRT calls (fopen, stat) are fine because main() puts the C locale in UTF-8
# mode, which is why creating the file always worked and only listing it did
# not: the failure was invisible until you looked.
#
# The driver is a UTF-8 source FILE, not an --eval argument, because the
# reader decodes UTF-8 from a stream and not from a C string.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_utf8_filenames.sh [path-to-clamiga]
