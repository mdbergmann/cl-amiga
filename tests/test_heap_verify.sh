#!/bin/sh
# (ext:%heap-verify): collect, then check every live object's header and
# child references, the registered static roots and the thread stacks
# against the real object starts.  A healthy heap answers 0 under both
# collectors, before and after a heavy load (compiling a library, which
# fragments and compacts), with a report that ends in the block count.
#
# Why: a corrupted heap surfaces as an unrelated error long after the
# fact, and on the Amiga stderr is never seen -- this is the probe a
# script can call after each LOAD to find where a corruption entered
# (the layout-dependent Amiga-written-FASL finding of 2026-09-18).
# Under CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1 (`make test-gc-stress`, the DEBUG_GC_STRESS build)
# every allocation compacts, so the churn shrinks to a few objects of each
# kind %heap-verify walks: what is checked there is that the verifier's own
# allocations (its collection, its report string) survive a compaction on
# every allocation, not the volume of heap it walks.
# Run: sh tests/test_heap_verify.sh [path-to-clamiga]
