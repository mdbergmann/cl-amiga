# Regression test: clamiga must never hang after a --load completes.
#
# Bug: `make test` -> host-cold-test ran clamiga in INTERACTIVE mode without
# redirecting stdin, so once the loaded script (the sento suite) finished,
# main.c fell through to cl_repl(), which blocked in platform_read_line() on a
# terminal that never sends EOF.  `make test` hung forever after the suite had
# already passed.
#
# Two independent guarantees pin the fix the cold-test now relies on:
#   A. --non-interactive runs the --load/--eval actions then exits, never
#      entering the REPL — even when stdin stays open (here a `sleep` holds the
#      pipe's write end open past the timeout).
#   B. With stdin redirected from /dev/null, the post-load REPL sees EOF
#      immediately and exits cleanly.
# A regression on either path would block on stdin and trip the timeout (124).
#
# Run: sh tests/test_load_exit.sh build/host/clamiga

# Both assertions need a timeout binary to bound the "does it hang?" check.
# Skip cleanly when absent (matches the repo's skip-when-prereq-missing rule).
