/* Regression test for the growable GC mark stack.
 *
 * Symptom (found 2026-07-05 investigating "loading from Sly is 60% slower
 * than a fresh REPL"): with the mark stack FIXED at CL_GC_MARK_STACK_SIZE
 * (4096) entries, any object with more unmarked children than the stack's
 * free slots (a >4K-element vector, a big hash table) silently overflowed
 * it.  Overflow recovery re-scans the ENTIRE arena for marked objects and
 * re-pushes their children — but each pass recovers at most ~one-stack-full
 * of dropped children, so a large live heap needs live/capacity passes,
 * each O(live edges).  Measured on a 210MB live heap: 49 s per mark-sweep
 * vs 35 ms with a large-enough stack (1400x).  Long-lived images (Sly
 * sessions, big application loads) hit this on every GC cycle.
 *
 * Fix: the mark stack starts on a small static buffer and grows
 * geometrically on demand (heap-proportional cap), keeping the re-scan
 * loop only as the correctness fallback for growth failure (cap/OOM).
 *
 * This test asserts three things:
 *   1. A wide object graph (one vector with many cons children) marks
 *      WITHOUT any overflow re-scan pass — growth handled it.
 *   2. A compacting (moving) GC over the same graph relocates it intact.
 *   3. With growth artificially capped (test hook), the overflow re-scan
 *      fallback still marks the graph completely and correctly — nothing
 *      live is lost, it is merely slow.  This path was previously the ONLY
 *      path; it must stay correct for genuine OOM-during-GC situations.
