# Ctrl-D at the Inspect> prompt exits the INSPECTOR, not the REPL (issue #25).
#
# Same contract as the debugger prompt (issue #13, tests/test_debugger_eof.sh):
# EOF leaves the interactive loop and hands control back — for INSPECT that
# means returning from the call like `q` does — and the session keeps running;
# a second Ctrl-D at the top-level prompt exits.  The inspector loop already
# fell out on EOF, but it left stdio's sticky EOF flag set, so the REPL's very
# next fgets returned EOF and the session died ("Bye.") anyway — the inspector
# now clears the flag (platform_clear_stdin_eof) before returning.
#
# The inspector prompt only makes sense at a real tty, so this needs a PTY —
# driven with expect(1), and skipped where it isn't installed (Linux CI
# images, MSYS2).
#
# Run: sh tests/test_inspect_eof.sh build/host/clamiga
