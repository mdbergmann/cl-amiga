# EXT:BACKTRACE in a top-level form that follows a form whose error was
# handled.  Every error snapshots its frame depth (cl_debug_base_fp, for the
# debugger to inspect the error-time stack); a loader that does not drop the
# snapshot between top-level forms leaves it stale, and a later
# (ext:backtrace) then reports only the frames below that old depth -- the
# innermost ones are cut off.  The --load loop reset it; LOAD of a source
# file, LOAD from a stream and LOAD of a FASL did not (found when a JIT
# shadow-frame check in tests/amiga/test-jit.lisp, which the suite loads
# through the FASL cache, lost its innermost frame).
# Run: sh tests/test_backtrace_after_handled_error.sh [path-to-clamiga]
