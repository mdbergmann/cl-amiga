# Regression: quicklisp's network layers must arm socket timeouts.
#
# Field hang (MorphOS, 2026-07-28): (cl-amiga-ql:install) wedged half-way
# through the client-tar download — the connection stalled and the READFILL
# parked in the socket reactor with NO deadline armed (socket_rtimeout
# defaults to 0 = block forever), leaving the whole image in Wait until
# Ctrl-C.  Both quicklisp network layers opened their connections with a
# bare (ext:open-tcp-stream host port):
#   - lib/quicklisp.lisp     (quickstart bootstrap, used by the installer)
#   - lib/quicklisp-compat.lisp (post-install dist downloads)
# The fix arms a 30s connect timeout and 60s read/write timeouts, so a
# stalled transfer raises EXT:SOCKET-TIMEOUT instead of hanging forever.
#
# This test loads the quickstart's network layer (no network access — the
# connection goes to a listener inside the same image) and asserts the
# stream returned by its OPEN-CONNECTION really has the timeouts armed.
# The timeout *mechanics* (expiry raises EXT:SOCKET-TIMEOUT) are covered
# by the socket tests in tests/amiga/run-tests.lisp.
#
# lib/quicklisp-compat.lisp cannot be loaded without a quicklisp install,
# so its (identical) wiring is asserted textually below instead.
