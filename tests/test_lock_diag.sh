# Slow-lock-wait diagnostic (CLAMIGA_LOCK_DIAG): a blocking MP:ACQUIRE-LOCK
# that waits past the threshold must report — to stderr, from inside the
# stalled wait — the contended lock (id + name), the waiting thread, the
# current holder (name + wait state), and finally the total wait once the
# lock is acquired.  Built for triaging intermittent multi-minute stalls
# (a loader parked on a lock another thread holds) from clamiga's own
# output, where MP:DUMP-THREAD-WAITS would need a watchdog to fire at
# exactly the right moment.
#
# Also verifies the diagnostic is OFF by default: without the env var the
# same contended run must print nothing.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_lock_diag.sh build/host/clamiga
