# Regression tests for two thread-lifecycle GC bugs:
#
# 1. STW hang on thread exit (thread.c cl_thread_unregister):
#    cl_gc_stop_the_world parks in platform_condvar_wait(gc_condvar)
#    waiting for a straggler thread to reach a safepoint.  A worker that
#    had already passed its LAST safepoint and was exiting never stopped
#    — it unregistered from cl_thread_list without waking gc_condvar, so
#    the initiator (whose re-scan would have found the list shrunk) slept
#    forever: GC, and with it the whole process, hung.  The scenario
#    below hammers the exact window: many short-lived threads exiting
#    while the main thread forces GCs in a tight loop.  A hang shows up
#    as the watchdog timeout killing the run (non-zero exit).
#
#    That scenario exercises the code path under load but cannot be
#    relied on to actually land in the narrow race window on a given
#    host/scheduler — see Case 1b below for a deterministic trigger.
#
# 1b. Deterministic trigger for the same bug: when a second argument is
#    given, it must be a clamiga built with -DDEBUG_THREAD_RACE_HOOKS (see
#    `make test-mt-thread-exit-race`).  That build's constructor
#    (src/core/thread.c) spawns one worker that never reaches a safepoint
#    and forces it to unregister at the exact instant the STW initiator
#    parks in platform_condvar_wait, closing the same window Case 1 can
#    only hope to hit.  If cl_thread_unregister's wakeup regresses, this
#    hangs (caught by `timeout` below) instead of racily passing.
#
# 2. First-worker double-registered GC roots (builtins_thread.c):
#    two racing first-worker creations could both see the abort
#    handler/report caches as NIL and both cl_gc_register_root the same
#    address.  gc_forward is not idempotent, so a double-registered root
#    is forwarded twice on compaction and lands on an unrelated object.
#    Roots are now registered once at boot; (ext:%gc-audit-roots) must
#    report 0 violations after threads were created from two racing
#    parents.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_thread_exit_gc.sh build/host/clamiga [race-hook-clamiga]
