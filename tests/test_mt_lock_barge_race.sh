# Deterministic reproduction of the lost lock wakeup found by the sento
# shared/ask-s cell on the first heap-word lock implementation
# (specs/mp-locks-heap-words.md, "Implementation notes").
#
# The interleaving: a contended acquirer (past its spin phase) marks the
# holder's state word CONTENDED, the holder releases and scans the waiter
# list BEFORE the acquirer is registered (nobody to wake), a barging
# newcomer takes the now-free lock with a plain word, the acquirer — now
# registered — sees "held" and parks, and the newcomer's release, seeing no
# CONTENDED bit, never scans: the parked thread is stranded on a free lock.
# The fix registers first and then marks whoever holds the lock NOW.
#
# The three-way timing cannot be forced from Lisp, so this runs against a
# -DDEBUG_THREAD_RACE_HOOKS binary whose lock_acquire_slow sleeps
# CLAMIGA_RACE_LOCK_MARK_DELAY_MS between registering and marking
# (CLAMIGA_RACE_SELFTEST=0 keeps that binary's start-up self-test from
# running and exiting before the program).  With
# the window held open for 300 ms, the main thread releases the lock and
# immediately re-acquires it plain (the barge) inside that window every
# time; the waiter must still be woken by main's final release.
#
