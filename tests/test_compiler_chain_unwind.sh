# Compiler-chain unwind across non-local exits (anchor-based, both directions).
#
# 1. LEAK direction: a compile-time error caught by HANDLER-CASE longjmps to
#    the VM's NLX landing.  The abandoned cl_compile_env compiler must be
#    freed there — the old protect-flag walk stopped at it and left it on
#    the active-compiler chain forever, so every later "top-level" compile
#    became its child and inherited its stale optimize settings: DECLAIM/
#    PROCLAIM appeared dead for the rest of the session (Amiga suite
#    failures "the safety 0" and "declaim survives fasl round trip").
#
# 2. LIVE direction: a macroexpander performing a non-local exit that lands
#    INSIDE a nested VM run must NOT free the enclosing in-progress
#    compiler (the use-after-free the protect flag was originally added
#    for — babel's INSTANTIATE-CONCRETE-MAPPINGS).  The anchor test keeps
#    any compiler owned by a still-live C frame.
#
