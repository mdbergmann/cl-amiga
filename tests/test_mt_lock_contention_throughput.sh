# Regression test (GC audit tier 4 follow-up): contended MP:ACQUIRE-LOCK
# handoff must be wakeup-driven, not sleep-polled.
#
# The tier-4 I5 fix made blocking acquire-lock interruptible by replacing
# platform_mutex_lock with a trylock loop; past the 256-yield spin phase
# it slept 10ms per round.  A waiter that escalated once (long hold, GC
# pause, preemption) stayed on the 10ms grid for the rest of that acquire
# even after the lock came free — under sento's message-box contention
# (8 producers + workers on one queue lock) that collapsed message
# throughput ~6x and its mixed ask/tell counter test failed its 3s
# assert-cond window deterministically.
#
# The fix parks contended acquirers on the shared cl_lock_park_cv, which
# bi_release_lock broadcasts whenever waiters are registered — a handoff
# wakes the waiter immediately.
#
# Probe: hold the lock while a waiter escalates past its spin phase
# (60ms), then release and measure release->acquired latency.  Sleep-poll
# wakes on the 10ms grid (avg ~5ms per round); parking wakes on the
# broadcast (sub-ms).  Average over 20 rounds, assert < 3ms — a wide
# margin on both sides, and a latency probe stays valid on a loaded CI
# host where a total-throughput deadline would flake.
#
# Also hammers one lock from 8 threads with work under the lock and
# checks the final counter: mutual exclusion + every parked waiter woken.
#
