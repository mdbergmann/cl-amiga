# The binary release compiles the editor's modules to lib/clamacs/*.fasl
# with the MUI frontend set and then insists that every module got one --
# except the sources that are no module on an Amiga: load.lisp, the
# run-from-source entry point clamacs.lisp, and the HOST editor's own
# modules (the webview frontend, its port, the TCP wire), which
# clamacs.lisp loads only off the Amiga.  This pins the two lists to each
# other: a host-only module clamacs.lisp adds must be exempted in
# scripts/make-binary-release.sh (or the release fails at the check, as
# 0.11's first snapshot did), and no exemption may name a module that
# clamacs.lisp does not treat as host-only (it would hide a missing FASL).
#
# Run: sh tests/test_release_clamacs_modules.sh   (no clamiga binary needed)
