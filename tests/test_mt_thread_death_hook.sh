#!/bin/sh
# Executable specification for MP:*THREAD-DEATH-HOOKS* (src/core/builtins.c,
# cl_run_thread_death_hooks).
#
# A worker thread that an unhandled error ends was gone without a word, and
# the error that ends most of them -- the heap exhausted -- resets the
# handler and NLX stacks before it unwinds, so no HANDLER-CASE and no
# UNWIND-PROTECT of the thread's own sees it.  The editor's REPL thread died
# that way in the middle of a system load and the editor waited for a RESULT
# that never came.
#
# The hooks are called with (THREAD MESSAGE) on the dying thread:
#   - for a thread that exhausted the heap, with room to run in,
#   - for a thread an ordinary unhandled error ended,
#   - NOT for a thread that returned, took ABORT, or was destroyed,
#   - a hook that fails does not keep the next one from running.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_thread_death_hook.sh build/host/clamiga
