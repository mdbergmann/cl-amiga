# Regression test: multi-threaded moving-GC must not corrupt objects whose
# roots are relocated by a peer thread's stop-the-world compaction.
#
# This guards a cluster of GC-safety fixes on multi-thread paths where a value
# lived only in an unprotected C local (or an unmarked per-thread field) across
# an allocating call, so a PEER thread's compaction relocated it and left the
# holder with a stale offset:
#
#   * thread_entry() abort-restart setup: abort_report/abort_handler/abort_tag
#     held unprotected across get_thread_abort_handler / cl_cons / cl_make_restart
#     (corrupted a worker's restart_stack[0]).
#   * SUBSEQ list path: the source cursor `list` reassigned by cl_cdr and left
#     unprotected across cl_cons.
#   * print_list(): the list-walk cursor unprotected across print_obj (which can
#     allocate via a Lisp print-object method).
#   * cl_get_output_stream_string(): the raw `st` (and `stream` offset) held
#     across the result-string allocation, then used for the outbuf reset — under
#     multi-thread FORMAT this reset a peer's live outbuf.
#   * pr_stream / pr_circle_keys: per-thread printer CL_Obj roots that GC never
#     marked or forwarded.
#
# The single-threaded REPL never hit these: it only compacts at its own
# allocation points, where the GC-protection convention already holds; the
# hazard is a PEER relocating a thread that is parked at an arbitrary safepoint.
#
# The scenario runs the main thread and a worker through make-instance + CLOS
# dispatch + FORMAT-of-nested-list + SUBSEQ churn while forcing a moving
# compaction (ext:gc-compact), across several worker generations, each thread
# validating its own results.  Reproduction is probabilistic per run (a stale
# offset often lands on a plausible object), so the binary is run several times;
# any corruption / crash / hang in ANY run fails the test.  Before the fixes at
# least one run corrupts (or crashes); after them every run prints MT-GC-DONE.
