# MP locks and condition variables as heap words (specs/mp-locks-heap-words.md).
#
# One regression test per clause of the design:
#   - cap gone: 100,000 live locks at once (the sento shared/ask wall was
#     16,384), then released and collected;
#   - misuse signals instead of hanging or corrupting: release by a
#     non-owner, release of a free lock, re-acquire of a plain lock by its
#     owner, condition-wait without the lock, bad timeouts;
#   - a recursive lock held at depth 2 across a condition-wait comes back at
#     depth 2 (two releases needed);
#   - one wakeup per release: N parked waiters, N releases, N acquisitions;
#   - acquire-lock's timeout argument (NIL forever, 0 one attempt, wait-p NIL
#     ignores it, NIL on timeout, T when the holder releases in time);
#   - timeout racing notify: a 1 ms timed wait against a notifier firing at
#     the same instant, many rounds — the waiter count must return to zero
#     every time (a notify that lands at the timeout instant is exactly one
#     of "notified" / "timed out");
#   - lost-wakeup soak: 8 threads ping-pong through a lock and a condvar with
#     randomised notify timing; a hang is the failure (the timeout below).

;; release, seeing no CONTENDED bit, never scans.  Eight threads on one lock
;; with an empty critical section and occasional parks reproduce the three-
;; way interleaving within seconds; the fix marks the CURRENT holder after
;; registering.  A hang is the failure.
;; The same soak also caught a mutual-exclusion hole: the contended release
;; stored 0 without a release fence, so on ARM64 the store could become
;; visible before the critical section's own writes and the next owner
;; read stale data (one lost INCF in 320,000).  Besides the counter, each
;; thread stamps a shared cell on entry and checks the stamp before it
;; leaves — a second thread inside the section shows up as a foreign stamp.
