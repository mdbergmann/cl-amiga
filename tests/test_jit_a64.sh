# The AArch64 JIT's plumbing end to end (specs/native-backend-a64.md, phase
# 0): %JIT-COMPILE-STUB assembles `mov w0, #0; ret` (asm_a64.c), installs it
# in the executable code heap (codeheap.c), and OP_CALL enters it through
# cl_jit_invoke -- so the stubbed function returns NIL whatever its body
# says.  Then the native code has to go away again: a redefinition drops
# it, and a collection releases the dead function's block.
#
# A host without the backend (x86-64, Linux, Windows, `make host JIT=0`)
# returns NIL from %JIT-COMPILE-STUB; the test then checks only that and
# passes.  Also run by `make test-gc-stress` (CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1).
# Run: sh tests/test_jit_a64.sh [path-to-clamiga]
