; Peephole differential corpus (spec 1.8).

; Run twice by tests/test_peephole_diff.sh — once with CLAMIGA_FORCE_SPEED=0
; (peephole off) and once with CLAMIGA_FORCE_SPEED=3 (peephole on for every
; compile) — and the printed output must be byte-identical.  Every form
; below exercises a rewrite pattern or a guard the pass must respect:
; store-then-reload chains, discarded pure values, (not ...) branch fusion,
; jump threading through nested conditionals, dead code, NLX landing-pad
; relocation (tagbody/go, catch/throw, unwind-protect, block/return-from),
; multiple-values state, closures, and type errors from discarded values.
;
; Results print via a single reporting function so the output is stable and
; machine-diffable.
