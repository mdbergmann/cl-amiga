/* Regression test for the "sweep-forever" GC pathology.
 *
 * Symptom: cold-compiling a large system (e.g. chipi-ui's ~700-file dep
 * closure) took ~9 minutes at some heap sizes and ~1 minute at others, with
 * the slow runs spending nearly all their time in the GC.  Collection counts
 * were wildly non-monotonic in heap size (e.g. 192M -> 1293 collections / 264s,
 * 256M -> 15 / 54s, 512M -> 203 / 135s) — a *bigger* heap triggering *more*
 * collections is the tell that this is a trigger pathology, not heap pressure.
 *
 * Root cause (mem.c, cl_alloc slow path):
 *   - Once the bump pointer is exhausted, allocation falls back to a bounded
 *     (CL_FREELIST_PROBE_LIMIT) first-fit free-list probe.
 *   - On a miss, cl_alloc ran a full mark-and-sweep cl_gc().  But a sweep-only
 *     GC never resets the bump pointer — it only re-coalesces the free list.
 *   - Compaction (which DOES reset the bump pointer and defragment) only fired
 *     when the *post-sweep* probe also missed.  When the post-sweep probe
 *     happened to find a fit (a recently-dead object swept onto the list head),
 *     ptr != NULL and compaction was skipped — so the next allocation was right
 *     back in the same state, sweeping again.  Result: a full-heap mark-sweep
 *     on nearly every allocation, forever.
 *
 * Fix: track sweeps-since-last-compaction.  After GC_SWEEPS_BEFORE_COMPACT
 * bump-exhausted sweeps without lasting progress (and when the heap is not
 * genuinely near-full), compact instead of sweeping — resetting the bump
 * pointer, defragmenting, and restoring a long run of O(1) bump allocations.
 *
 * This test rebuilds the sweep-forever shape and asserts the escape hatch
 * holds: collections stay bounded and compaction fires.  Validated to actually
 * reproduce: with the fix disabled (-DGC_SWEEPS_BEFORE_COMPACT large) this same
 * workload drives the collection count into the thousands; with the fix it
 * stays an order of magnitude smaller.
