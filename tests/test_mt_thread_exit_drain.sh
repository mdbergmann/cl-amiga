# Process exit waits for workers that already left the MP registry.
#
# A worker drops out of the registry (cl_thread_count, THREAD-ALIVE-P NIL) a
# few steps before its OS thread is gone.  On AmigaOS a worker still in that
# exit tail when main returns runs on into the unloaded program code — the
# intermittent "68k exception" in CL-Thread at the end of Clamacs drive runs
# (MorphOS, FS-UAE).  cl_thread_shutdown now drains such workers first.
#
# MP::%SET-THREAD-EXIT-DELAY holds the tail open so the window is hit every
# time instead of once in a few runs:
#   - the hooks: %OS-THREAD-COUNT still counts a finished worker while its
#     tail runs, %DRAIN-OS-THREADS waits it out (and gives up with the
#     straggler count when the timeout is shorter), JOIN-THREAD still works;
#   - exit: QUIT right after the worker left the registry must not return
#     before its tail ends (wall time >= the delay), without a warning;
#   - exit with a tail longer than the 2 s bound: the process still exits,
#     and says how many workers it left behind.
#
# Run: sh tests/test_mt_thread_exit_drain.sh build/host/clamiga

# --- a second worker unregisters mid-drain: the wait target must track it,

# Worker A is already unregistered and mid-tail (a 1000 ms straggler) when
# QUIT runs, so cl_thread_shutdown's drain starts with keep=1 (worker B,
# still registered). Worker B then finishes its own 700 ms body and
# unregisters WHILE the drain is still polling for A's tail. A drain that
# snapshots keep=1 once declares "drained" the instant A's tail ends
# (~1000 ms) — B has by then already dropped out of the registry but its own
# 1000 ms tail is still ~700 ms from finishing. A correct drain re-samples
# the registered count and must wait out B's tail too (~1700 ms total).
