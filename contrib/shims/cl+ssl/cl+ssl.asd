;;;; cl+ssl.asd --- cl+ssl-compatible facade over cl-amiga's native TLS.
;;;
;;; The real cl+ssl binds ~130 OpenSSL entry points through CFFI and pumps
;;; every TLS byte through Lisp BIO callbacks — a stack that only works on
;;; the POSIX host (libffi + dlopen) and can never work on AmigaOS/MorphOS,
;;; where the FFI has no dlopen, no generic C calls, and no callbacks.
;;;
;;; cl-amiga instead implements TLS in the C runtime (EXT:SOCKET-START-TLS,
;;; backed by OpenSSL on the host, AmiSSL on AmigaOS, openssl3.library on
;;; MorphOS) and this shim provides the exact CL+SSL API surface that
;;; drakma and hunchentoot consume — MAKE-SSL-CLIENT-STREAM,
;;; MAKE-SSL-SERVER-STREAM, MAKE-CONTEXT, WITH-GLOBAL-CONTEXT,
;;; +SSL-VERIFY-NONE+, SSL-STREAM-X509-CERTIFICATE — on top of it.  Both
;;; load unmodified against this system.
;;;
;;; Installed into quicklisp's local-projects via `make install-shims`
;;; (symlink), where it shadows the quicklisp-dist cl+ssl.
