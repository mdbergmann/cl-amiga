;;; save-boot-image.lisp — write the bare-boot heap image a deployment ships
;;; beside its clamiga binary as `clamiga.img` (specs/image-save-load.md).
;;;
;;; Images are per-build, so this runs ON THE TARGET, with the binary that
;;; ships, from the directory that binary lives in, with nothing loaded but
;;; boot + CLOS:
;;;
;;;   cd bin/aos3
;;;   clamiga --no-userinit --no-image --non-interactive --load //scripts/save-boot-image.lisp
;;;
;;; (`//` is AmigaDOS for the grandparent directory: the native binary does
;;; not know `..`, so `../../scripts/...` fails there with "Cannot open
;;; file" -- that spelling is for a POSIX host only.)
;;;
;;; `make -f Makefile.cross image-amiga` runs it unattended in FS-UAE,
;;; `make -f Makefile.mos image` natively on MorphOS, and
;;; scripts/make-binary-release.sh runs it against the staged release layout
;;; (so the image is dumped from the very FASLs that ship).
;;; scripts/verify-boot-image.lisp checks the result.
;;;
;;; The image goes to the CURRENT directory: startup looks for an image
;;; beside the binary (PROGDIR: / the executable's directory), which is
;;; where a release keeps one per binary — a single image at the release
;;; root would be tried by every binary and refused by all but one.
