# lib/ packaging policy (correctness, not preference):
#   FASL   boot clos ffi gray-streams dev-commands dev-repl dev-tcp
#          — self-contained, no reader conditionals / compile-time feature
#          detection, so a host-compiled FASL is portable (FASLs are
#          arch/endian-neutral; boot.fasl + clos.fasl have shipped this way
#          all along).  dev-commands + dev-repl are the EXT.DEV command
#          layer behind the ARexx development port: amiga/arexx REQUIREs
#          them, so without them Clamacs cannot connect to a released
#          clamiga at all; dev-tcp is the same port over TCP (what a
#          host Clamacs drives an Amiga clamiga through).
#   FASL + SOURCE
#          amiga/**       — the curated modules, AMIGA.REACTION and the
#                           generated raw OS bindings (lib/amiga/raw/**): no
#                           reader conditionals, all platform variance is
#                           load-time ((member :morphos *features*),
#                           (%version>= n)) and every struct layout is an
#                           explicit 32-bit offset, so ONE host-compiled FASL
#                           serves aos3, aos3-fpu and MorphOS.  Precompiled
#                           because the alternative is compiling ~1 MB of
#                           generated source on a 68020 at first REQUIRE
#                           (minutes, plus compile heap).  The sources ship
#                           too, as the readable API reference and as the
#                           fallback REQUIRE takes if a FASL is ever rejected;
#                           the FASLs are written AFTER the sources are
#                           copied, so REQUIRE's "FASL at least as new as the
#                           source" rule picks the FASL.
#   SOURCE asdf.lisp      — uiop's (detect-os) runs at compile time and bakes
#                           :os-unix branches of the *compiling* host in.
#          quicklisp.lisp — contains #+amigaos reader conditionals.
#          quicklisp-compat.lisp, quicklisp-install.lisp — reference
#                           quicklisp packages that don't exist at host
#                           compile time (macros would compile wrong).
#          shims/         — the cl+ssl facade and swank stub ASDF systems.
#                           lib/asdf.lisp auto-registers them on
#                           ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY* (searched before the
#                           Quicklisp/ocicl searchers), so they shadow any
#                           package-manager copy with no installation step.
#   Source-shipped files compile on the target on first (require ...) and are
#   cached under S:cl-amiga/faslcache/, so the cost is paid once.
#
#   Every FASL is compiled with CLAMIGA_FASL_PORTABLE=1: the m68k AmigaOS
#   binaries are byte-string builds with no decoder for FASL_TAG_WIDE_STRING
#   (MorphOS is a wide build but loads the same FASLs), so a
#   non-ASCII string literal in a shipped module fails the build HERE with
#   the source line, not on the Amiga with BAD_TAG at REQUIRE time
#   (tests/test_lib_fasl_portable.sh runs the same compile in `make test`).
#
# Heap images (specs/image-save-load.md): each binary starts from the
# clamiga.img beside it — a snapshot of the booted runtime (boot + CLOS),
# restored in one read instead of loading the two FASLs form by form.
#   - One image PER BINARY, next to it.  Images are per-build (a fingerprint
#     ties them to version/format/FPU/platform) and PROGDIR: is the first
#     executable-relative place startup looks.  A single image at the
#     release root would be found via the cwd by all three binaries and
#     refused by two of them on every start.
#   - The host cannot write them the way it writes FASLs.  The aos3 pair is
#     saved by the staged m68k binaries themselves, unattended in FS-UAE
#     (verify/realamiga/make-image.sh against the staged layout, so each
#     image is dumped from the very FASLs that ship, then restarted from the
#     release root to verify).  The MorphOS one is saved natively
#     (`make -f Makefile.mos image`) and passed in as MOS_IMG.
#   - boot.fasl + clos.fasl still ship: they are what --no-image boots from
#     and the fallback when an image is refused.
#
# The binaries sit two directory levels below the release root on purpose:
# both the boot search (repl.c) and REQUIRE resolve lib/ via the
# executable-ancestor fallback (PROGDIR: two levels up), so the release runs
# from any current directory without assigns or environment variables.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/make-binary-release.sh [--no-smoke] [--snapshot [--with-mos]]
#
#   --snapshot     AmigaOS-only development snapshot of the working tree:
#                  no bin/mos/ (no MorphOS inputs needed), staged and
#                  archived as clamiga-<version>-snapshot-<git short sha>
#                  so it never masquerades as, or overwrites, a release.
#                  Everything else (FASLs, heap images, smoke test) is the
#                  release procedure.
#   --with-mos     With --snapshot: package bin/mos/ after all, from the
#                  MOS_BIN / MOS_IMG / CLAMACS_MOS_IMG inputs below (built
#                  on MorphOS from the snapshot's commit).  A full release
#                  always includes it.
#
#   MOS_BIN=path   MorphOS binary to package (default: ./clamiga-mos).
#                  There is no MorphOS cross toolchain here — build it
#                  natively with Makefile.mos and copy it over.
#   MOS_IMG=path   Its bare-boot heap image (default: ./clamiga-mos.img),
#                  saved on MorphOS by THAT binary from the same source
#                  tree: `make -f Makefile.mos image` writes
#                  build/morphos/clamiga.img (and verifies it).
#   CLAMACS_MOS_IMG=path
#                  The MorphOS Clamacs heap image (default: ./clamacs-mos.img),
#                  saved on MorphOS by the MOS_BIN binary from the same source
#                  tree: `make -f Makefile.mos editor-image` writes
#                  build/morphos/clamacs.img (and verifies it).
#
# The aos3 images need the FS-UAE setup of `make -f Makefile.cross
# test-amiga` (pkill fs-uae first if an emulator is lingering; the editor
# image also needs the MUI + TextEditor.mcc on that Workbench).  The editor
# needs the clamacs/ submodule checked out: `git submodule update --init
# clamacs`.  No toolchain: it is Lisp, compiled by the host binary.
