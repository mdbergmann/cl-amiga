/* ---- Per-thread parking (token semantics) ----
 *
 * The blocking primitive behind the Lisp-visible MP locks and condition
 * variables (specs/mp-locks-heap-words.md).  A handle belongs to ONE
 * thread — the one that parks on it — and behaves like a binary
 * semaphore: `unpark` deposits a token, `park` blocks until a token is
 * present and consumes it.  An unpark that arrives BEFORE the matching
 * park is therefore never lost (the next park returns at once), which is
 * what lets a waiter register itself, re-check its condition and then
 * park without a timed backstop.  Two unparks are one token.
 *
 * park returns 0 when a token was consumed, 1 when timeout_ms elapsed
 * without one; timeout_ms == 0 waits forever.  Any thread may unpark;
 * only the owner parks, and only the owner may init/destroy its handle
 * (on AmigaOS the handle is a signal bit of the owning task).
 *
 * POSIX / Windows: a mutex, a condvar and a permit flag.  AmigaOS /
 * MorphOS: one AllocSignal() bit per thread; Wait() is the park,
 * Signal() the unpark, and a delivered signal stays set until consumed. */

/* Full memory barrier for lock-free flag/payload pairs read outside any
 * mutex (e.g. interrupt_func published before interrupt_pending, consumed
 * at safepoints without taking a lock).  Both sides need it: the writer
 * orders payload-before-flag, the reader orders flag-before-payload — on
 * weakly-ordered hosts (ARM64) either reorder loses the payload.  On the
 * single-core 68k this reduces to a compiler barrier. */

/* ---- TLS (for cl_current_thread) ----
 *
 * On POSIX, the per-thread CL_Thread* is held in a `__thread` variable so
 * the hot `cl_get_current_thread()` path is a single TLS load (e.g. an
 * `mrs tpidr_el0`-based access on ARM64) instead of a `pthread_getspecific`
 * libcall.  Profiling sento showed `pthread_getspecific` dominating the real
 * CPU work in multi-threaded mode (every `call_builtin`, `cl_gc_push_root`,
 * `cl_gc_pop_roots`, `cl_dynbind_restore_to`, `cl_alloc`, ... pays it).
 *
 * On Amiga, `tc_UserData` already serves this role with zero overhead, so
 * there `platform_tls_get` stays a tiny function call.
