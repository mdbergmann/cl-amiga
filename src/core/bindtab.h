/*
 * Demand-interned binding tables (specs/raw-bindings-footprint.md, Phase 2).
 *
 * A generated OS binding module (lib/amiga/raw/) defines ~2000 names;
 * a program touches a few dozen.  Instead of materialising every one at
 * load (symbol + value/FFI stub + export cons, ~110 bytes each), the
 * module ships ONE packed byte vector — the binding table — and attaches
 * it to its package (CL_Package.bindings).  The package lookup funnel in
 * package.c consults the table when a name is not present and builds the
 * symbol on first reference; everything the program never names costs
 * the table bytes only.  Once built, a symbol is an ordinary symbol of an
 * ordinary package: EQ, FIND-SYMBOL, SYMBOL-PACKAGE, #', FUNCALL, SETF,
 * TRACE all behave per CLHS.  Enumerating or mutating the symbol set
 * (DO-SYMBOLS, APROPOS, UNINTERN, IMPORT, ...) flips the package eager —
 * every entry is built and the table dropped — so no laziness is ever
 * observable except as memory.
 *
 * The one exception is deliberate and explicit: SAVE-IMAGE :SHAKE-BINDINGS
 * SHEDS the tables (cl_bindtab_shed) for image-based delivery, where the
 * set of referenced names is closed by definition.  A shed package is
 * closed at the names it has — the rest stop existing.
 *
 * Blob layout (big-endian throughout, so the FASL byte-vector literal is
 * byte-identical on the LE host and the BE m68k target):
 *
 *   header  16 bytes:  u32 magic "CLBT", u8 version, u8 flags,
 *                      u16 reserved, u32 n_entries, u32 names_len
 *   entries n x 16:    u32 name_off, u16 name_len, u8 kind, u8 flags,
 *                      u32 a, i16 b, u8 c, u8 d        — sorted by name
 *   name arena:        names_len bytes (ASCII, no terminators), plus the
 *                      payloads of CL_BT_F_WIDE values (u8 nbytes, u8 sign,
 *                      big-endian magnitude) and CL_BT_F_STRING values
 *                      (u8 len, ASCII bytes)
 *
 * Per kind:
 *   CL_BT_CONST / CL_BT_VAR   value: a as u32, or i32 when CL_BT_F_SIGNED,
 *                             or the integer at arena[a] when CL_BT_F_WIDE,
 *                             or the string at arena[a] when CL_BT_F_STRING
 *                             (a C header's string #define — MUIC_Window
 *                             "Window.mui"; materialised as a fresh simple
 *                             string).
 *                             CONST -> CL_SYM_CONSTANT, VAR -> CL_SYM_SPECIAL
 *                             (a DEFCSTRUCT's *NAME-SIZE*).
 *   CL_BT_LIBCALL             a regspec (nibbles | result kind << 28),
 *                             b LVO, c nparams, d minimum library version
 *                             (0 = none); flags CL_BT_F_(NOT_)MORPHOS.
 *                             -> CL_STUB_LIBCALL stub on the package's
 *                             base-variable symbol.
 *   CL_BT_FIELD               d the reader stub kind (CL_STUB_PEEK /
 *                             PEEK_IDX / FIELD_PTR), c ctype, a offset
 *                             (| count << 16 for the indexed kinds), b
 *                             element size.  The writer %SET-<NAME>
 *                             (POKE / POKE_IDX) is derived — built with
 *                             the reader, registered as its DEFSETF.
 *   CL_BT_NAME                export only: the definition comes from an
 *                             ordinary form that follows the table (the
 *                             >7-register DEFCFUNs over CALL-LIBRARY).
 *
 * Guards are evaluated at PROBE time against *FEATURES* and the module's
 * version variable; a name whose every variant fails still materialises
 * (exported, unbound) — exactly what the eager `(when guard (defcfun ..))`
 * forms produced, so FBOUNDP-style feature probes keep working.
