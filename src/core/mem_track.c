/* Off-heap allocation leak tracer (opt-in, compiled to nothing otherwise).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * clamiga allocates two very different kinds of memory.  Lisp objects live in
 * the GC arena, and ROOM accounts for every byte of it.  Everything else —
 * bytecode bodies, constants pools, compiler scratch, hash indexes, I/O
 * buffers, the JIT's code — is platform_alloc'd and invisible to every
 * statistic the runtime otherwise reports.
 *
 * On a host that gap is harmless: the kernel reclaims the whole address space
 * at exit.  On AmigaOS there is no such reclaim.  A block clamiga does not
 * hand back before the process ends is gone from the system pool until the
 * machine is rebooted, so a run that forgets 3 MB costs the user 3 MB of Fast
 * RAM per launch — which is exactly what was measured on a Vampire before the
 * shutdown paths were fixed.  A leak a host build cannot even observe is, on
 * the target platform, the most user-visible bug the runtime has.
 *
 * HOW TO USE IT
 *
 *   make host DEBUG_FLAGS=-DDEBUG_MEM_TRACK
 *   make -f Makefile.cross amiga DEBUG_FLAGS=-DDEBUG_MEM_TRACK
 *
 * Then run with CLAMIGA_MEM_DIAG=1.  At exit every block still outstanding is
 * reported, grouped by the file and line that allocated it, largest first —
 * the answer to "what did we forget to free?", not a hint toward it.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 *
 * platform.h redirects platform_alloc / platform_free to the two functions
 * below, tagging each call site via __FILE__ / __LINE__.  Live blocks are
 * held in a SIDE TABLE keyed by pointer — deliberately not a header prefixed
 * to each allocation.  A header would have to be read back on free, and
 * clamiga legitimately hands platform_free pointers this tracer never issued:
 * platform_file_read returns a malloc'd (POSIX) or AllocVec'd (Amiga) buffer
 * that its caller releases with platform_free.  Reading a header off one of
 * those is a wild access before the start of the block.  A pointer lookup
 * simply misses instead, and the block is passed through to the real free.
 *
 * The table is fixed-size and allocation-free: the tracer must not perturb
 * what it measures, and it has to keep working after the allocator it wraps
 * has begun to fail.
 *
 * This file is the ONE place that must reach the real allocator, so it
 * defines CL_MEM_TRACK_IMPL before including platform.h to opt out of the
 * macros.  The platform back-ends do the same, since they define the
 * functions being wrapped.
