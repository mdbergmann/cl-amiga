 * Lock builtins
 *
 * A lock is a heap word (CL_Lock in types.h): `state` is 0 when free, or
 * the owner's thread serial shifted up one bit, with bit 0
 * (CL_LOCK_CONTENDED) set once some thread has had to park on it.  The
 * runtime allocates no OS mutex per lock.  Blocking goes through each
 * thread's own park handle (platform_park, token semantics): a waiter
 * marks the lock CONTENDED, registers itself (wait_kind / wait_obj, under
 * cl_thread_list_lock), re-checks the lock, and parks; a releaser that
 * sees CONTENDED stores 0 and scans the thread list for ONE thread
 * registered on this lock and unparks it.  The uncontended paths are a
 * single CAS each and never take a lock or scan anything.  The shape is
 * Drepper's "mutex 2" ("Futexes Are Tricky") with a registration list in
 * place of the futex — see specs/mp-locks-heap-words.md for the
 * invariants, and the "Lost wakeups" risk there for why every abandon
 * path (timeout, interrupt) hands the lock on before leaving.
 *
 * GC discipline: a CL_Lock* / CL_CondVar* is re-derived from its GC-rooted
 * args[] slot after anything that can run a compaction — a park (safe
 * region), cl_thread_handle_interrupt (runs Lisp), any allocation.  The
 * objects move; the rooted slot is forwarded.  The registration fields
 * (wait_obj / wait_lock) are thread roots for the same reason.
