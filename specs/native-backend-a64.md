# Native Code Backend (AArch64)

Status: phases 0 and 1 on master, phase 2 on branch `feat/a64-jit-p2`, phase 3 on
`feat/a64-jit-p3` (2026-10-02; see each phase's status note).  Proposal from 2026-10-01; both
prerequisites are on master: direct native-to-native calls
(`specs/jit-direct-calls.md`, 27c74b00) and the loop poll
(`specs/native-backend.md`, "Status (2026-10-01, native loops poll)",
b8f57acc).

A template JIT for 64-bit ARM hosts, Apple Silicon macOS first, then
Linux.  It is the m68k backend's sibling (`specs/native-backend.md`): it
uses the same bytecode, lazy compilation policy (`specs/lazy-jit.md`),
runtime helpers (`src/jit/runtime.c`) and dispatch path.  Only instruction
selection, the frame layout and the executable-memory plumbing are new.

## Motivation

- **Speed on the development host.**  Interpreted code on an M-series
  Mac is fast, but fixnum loops, struct access and call-heavy code still
  pay for dispatch on every opcode.  The m68k numbers
  (`trunk/bench-jit-loop.lisp`, `trunk/bench-jit-call.lisp`) show what a
  template JIT takes off that.
- **JIT bugs found under `make test`.**  Today every JIT change is
  verified only in FS-UAE.  A second backend that shares the walker's
  structure and all of `runtime.c` runs the runtime helpers, the
  hot-compile policy, NLX through native frames and the GC interaction
  natively, under the gc-stress suite, in CI (`macos-latest` is arm64).
- **A second CPU before MorphOS.**  A PPC JIT would follow the same
  recipe; doing it once on the host proves the split.

## Non-goals

- No optimizing tier, no speculation, no deoptimization (see the
  evergreen assessment that led here: the template JIT's inline fast path
  with a slow-path call already behaves like speculation that never fails).
- No x86-64 backend.
- No Windows ARM64 in this spec: `longjmp` there unwinds with SEH and
  would need unwind tables for every JIT frame (evergreen's
  `native_transfer/win64.rs` is that work for x86-64).  The build keeps
  the stubs on Windows.

## What we take from evergreen, and what not

Evergreen (github.com/atgreen/evergreen) is GPL-3.0 with a Classpath
exception; clamiga is Apache-2.0.  **No code is copied.**  Encodings come
from the Arm ARM (DDI 0487, C4.1); the ideas below are design, not text.

Taken:

1. **Encoders are plain functions.**  One C function per instruction,
   returning the 32-bit word, or failing when an operand does not fit its
   field so the caller emits a longer form (`movz`/`movk` for a wide
   constant, a register-offset load for a far displacement).  Every
   encoder is pinned by a unit test.
2. **A sibling walker, not a portability layer.**  `jit_walk_a64.c`
   mirrors the m68k walker case by case, with its own register roles.
   No abstract "emit add" interface over both CPUs.
3. **One label/fixup pass.**  Branches go to labels that are bound later;
   every displacement is filled in and range-checked in one `finish` step.
4. **A first slice that cannot be wrong.**  Phase 1 runs the operand
   stack and control flow natively and sends every other opcode to the
   runtime, so its results are by construction the interpreter's.
5. **The JIT's frame is the interpreter's frame.**  Locals and the
   operand stack live on the GC-rooted `cl_vm.stack`, not on the native
   stack (see "GC interaction").
6. **Full instruction-cache maintenance.**  Their `jit.rs` documents an
   `ISB`-only flush that worked by accident.  We call
   `sys_icache_invalidate` on macOS and `__builtin___clear_cache` on Linux.

Not taken: tiering beyond lazy compile, type-feedback tables, deopt,
OSR, `regalloc2`.

## Architecture constraints from our runtime

- `CL_Obj` is a 32-bit arena offset, tag bit 0 = fixnum
  (`src/core/types.h`).  All Lisp values are handled in `w` registers;
  a heap address is `arena_base + uxtw(obj)`, which AArch64 addresses in
  one instruction: `ldr w0, [x23, w1, uxtw]`.
- VM stack slots are 4 bytes (`CL_Obj *cl_vm.stack`, index `cl_vm.sp`).
  The VM stack and the arena are allocated once and never move
  (`vm.c:257`, `mem.c:1052`).
- The host runs threads (per-thread `CL_Thread`, `cl_vm` = `CT->vm`),
  stop-the-world GC, and by default the generational collector, whose
  minors **move** young objects (`specs/generational-gc.md`).  The
  generational GC tracks old-space writes by `mprotect` faults, so stores
  from JIT code need no write barrier; the fault handler is address-based
  and does not care that the faulting PC is in JIT code.
- Host error frames use `_setjmp`/`_longjmp` (`src/core/error.h:29`), which
  on macOS and Linux arm64 restore registers without unwinding.  A
  `cl_error` from inside a helper drops the native frames above the
  catching C frame, exactly as on m68k.

## Register roles

AAPCS64 makes x19-x28 callee-saved, so these survive every helper call.
**x18 is reserved on Apple platforms and never used.**  x29/x30 form a
standard frame record so `lldb`, `sample` and crash reports walk through
JIT frames.

| Role                                  | m68k      | AArch64 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| current `CL_Thread *`                 | A3 (after direct-calls phase 2) | x19 |
| operand-stack pointer (next free slot in `cl_vm.stack`) | A7 (m68k stack) | x20 |
| locals base `bp` (`cl_vm.stack + bp`) | A6 frame  | x21 |
| literal pool (heap constants)         | baked immediates | x22 |
| arena base                            | A5        | x23 |
| top-of-stack cache (phase 2)          | D5-D7     | w24-w26 (built: w13-w15) |
| the function's `CL_Frame` (phase 3)   | -         | x25 |
| result / first helper argument        | D0        | w0 / x0 |
| scratch                               | D1-D3     | x9-x15 |
| far-call veneer                       | -         | x16, x17 |

Helper calls load the 64-bit helper address from a per-function constant
area at the end of the code (`ldr x16, lit; blr x16`).  Helper addresses
never move, so this area is never patched.

## Entry and frame layout

The native entry has one signature for every arity.  On m68k,
`cl_jit_invoke` enters native code through the assembly trampoline
`cl_jit_enter(void *entry, CL_Thread *thread, CL_Obj func, const CL_Obj
*argv, int32_t nargs)` (`src/jit/jit_enter_m68k.s`), which loads A3 and
copies the arguments onto the m68k stack.  AArch64 needs no trampoline:
the arguments stay where the caller pushed them, and the AAPCS64 argument
registers carry the rest, so `cl_jit_invoke` calls the entry directly:

```c
typedef CL_Obj (*cl_a64_entry_t)(CL_Thread *thr, CL_Obj *bp,
                                 uint32_t nargs, CL_Obj func_obj);
```

The arguments are already on `cl_vm.stack` (the caller pushed them).
The prologue:

1. saves x19-x26 and the frame record;
2. checks that `bp + n_locals + max_stack + 1` fits in the VM stack, and
   otherwise calls the helper that raises the interpreter's own
   stack-overflow error;
3. sets non-argument locals to NIL;
4. stores `func_obj` in a hidden slot right after the locals, so closure
   upvalues (`OP_UPVAL`) read it from rooted memory after any GC;
5. points x20 at the slot after that.

Frame in `cl_vm.stack`: `[args | other locals | func_obj | operand stack ...]`.
A `&key` function uses the same entry; its keyword prologue is the existing
`cl_jit_runtime_kw_prologue` helper, which already works on args in the VM
stack.

Who pops the arguments is unchanged: `cl_jit_invoke`'s contract with its
callers stays as it is today.

## GC interaction

The m68k JIT keeps its operand stack and interior locals on the CPU stack.
The GC therefore scans that stack conservatively and pins whatever it
finds (`specs/native-backend.md`, "GC interaction"), a scheme built for the
classic collector.  The generational collector has neither the header
index nor the pinning (`native-backend.md:451`).  The AArch64 backend
avoids all of it.

**Rule 1: at every call out of native code, every live `CL_Obj` is in
`cl_vm.stack` below `cl_vm.sp`.**
- Before a helper call (and before the `_setjmp` of an NLX frame) the
  code stores the top-of-stack cache registers to their slots and writes
  `cl_vm.sp` from x20.
- After the call it reloads x20 from `cl_vm.sp` and refills the cache
  lazily.
- No `CL_Obj` and no raw arena pointer lives in a register across a call.

Then the GC needs no knowledge of JIT frames: `cl_vm.stack` is already a
root, the hidden `func_obj` slot keeps the function and its bytecode
alive, and a moving minor or major collection forwards everything in
place.  `gc_scan_jit_native_stack` and the `jit_stack_top` bookkeeping
stay m68k-only.  This rule is the AArch64 form of the m68k
`cache_flush`-before-JSR rule, with memory instead of the CPU stack as
the target.

**Rule 2 (as built in phase 1): heap constants are read from
`bc->constants` at each use, never encoded in instructions.**  The prologue
loads the array's address (a 64-bit literal after the code) into x22, and
`OP_CONST` is `ldr w, [x22, #4*i]`.  The array is `platform_alloc`'d once
when the bytecode is born and never moves, and both collectors -- minor
collections included -- already forward its words in place, because the
interpreter reads constants from it.  `T` is read through the address of
the `CL_T` global.  So native code bakes no heap object at all: no pool, no
relocation table, and Rules 2 and 3 below as first proposed (kept for the
record) are not needed.

*As first proposed:* heap constants are loaded from a literal pool, never
encoded in instructions.  An AArch64 instruction cannot carry a 32-bit immediate
the way an m68k `move.l #imm` does, so the m68k scheme of patching
immediates inside the code does not carry over.
- Each compiled function gets a pool: an array of 32-bit words holding
  every heap `CL_Obj` the code uses (quoted constants, symbols, the
  self-bytecode, closure templates, `T`).
- The pool is ordinary `platform_alloc` memory, not executable memory.
  The prologue loads its address into x22.
- Code reads constants with `ldr w0, [x22, #4*i]`.

**Rule 3: both collectors forward every pool word.**
- On AArch64 `bc->native_relocs` points at the pool and
  `native_reloc_count` is its length.  The field is reused, so the
  `CL_Bytecode` layout is unchanged and neither `CL_IMAGE_VERSION` nor
  `CL_FASL_VERSION` changes.
- `GC_BYTECODE_TAIL` in `mem.c` gets an AArch64 branch that forwards each
  native-endian word in place.  Since the pool is data, no
  instruction-cache flush and no write-protect toggle is needed.
- The open point is **minor collections**: an old bytecode on a clean page
  is not visited by a minor, but its pool may hold a young constant that
  the minor moves.
  - Every installed pool is registered in a global list (added on
    install, removed when the bytecode's native code is freed).
  - Each collection, minor or major, forwards every word in that list
    after forwarding is computed.
  - A pool is a copy of `bc->constants`, so liveness still comes from the
    bytecode; the list only forwards and never marks.
- `tests/test_gc_jit_reloc.c` gets an AArch64 counterpart covering both
  collectors.

**Rule 4: native loops poll.**  The interpreter runs `CL_SAFEPOINT` and
the Ctrl-C poll on every backward jump (`vm.c`, `OP_JMP`).  On the host
a call-free native loop would otherwise stall every stop-the-world GC in
other threads forever.  Every loop header emits:

```
ldrh w9, [x19, #offsetof(CL_Thread, jit_loop_ctr)]
subs w9, w9, #1
strh w9, [x19, #offsetof(CL_Thread, jit_loop_ctr)]
b.lo poll_stub              ; borrow: sync sp, call cl_jit_runtime_loop_poll, reload
```

The poll counter is per-thread, as the hot-path rule in `CLAUDE.md`
requires.  The m68k walker lacked this poll too and gained it on
2026-10-01 (`specs/native-backend.md`, "Status (2026-10-01, native loops
poll)").  Its form is cheaper than the sequence above, and AArch64 should
copy it: a per-thread countdown `CL_Thread.jit_loop_ctr`, decremented at
every loop header and before each self-tail-call branch, and a call to
`cl_jit_runtime_loop_poll` every 256 iterations.  That helper runs the
safepoint, interrupt and Ctrl-C checks.  The `jit-loop-poll-*` checks in
`tests/amiga/test-jit.lisp` are the tests to port.

## Executable memory

A platform interface (`platform.h`, under `JIT_A64`), implemented in
`platform_posix.c` and used only by the code heap:

```c
void *platform_jit_map(uint32_t bytes);          /* a MAP_JIT chunk, or NULL  */
void  platform_jit_unmap(void *addr, uint32_t bytes);
void  platform_jit_write_begin(void);            /* this thread may write     */
void  platform_jit_write_end(void);              /* back to execute           */
void  platform_jit_flush(void *addr, uint32_t len); /* I-cache maintenance    */
```

- **macOS**: one `mmap(MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON|MAP_JIT, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|
  PROT_EXEC)` region per chunk.
  - `pthread_jit_write_protect_np(0)` before writing and
    `pthread_jit_write_protect_np(1)` after; the toggle is per-thread, so
    a thread compiling does not stop others from running JIT code.
  - Then `sys_icache_invalidate(p, n)`.
  - A locally built binary is not signed with the hardened runtime and
    needs no entitlement.  A signed build would need
    `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`.
- **Linux** (phase 4): a `memfd` mapped twice, a writable view and an
  executable view, because flipping `mprotect` on a page another thread
  is executing from is not safe.  Then `__builtin___clear_cache`.
  - So `platform_jit_map(bytes, &writable)` returns both views (the same
    address on macOS) and `platform_jit_unmap` takes both; the write
    window calls are no-ops on Linux.
  - The code heap keeps its block headers and free list in the writable
    view and translates only at its edges: install returns the
    executable address, free takes it back.

**Code allocator** (`src/jit/codeheap.{c,h}`):
- Apple pages are 16 KB, so one mapping per function would waste most of
  the memory.  Functions are carved from 1 MB chunks with a first-fit
  free list (16-byte granules, a block header inside the chunk, under a
  mutex, since threads compile concurrently).  A block larger than a
  chunk gets a chunk of its own.  Free blocks are not coalesced yet.
- `cl_codeheap_install(code, len)` copies finished code in and flushes;
  `cl_codeheap_free` refuses pointers it did not hand out and double frees.
- The bytecode sweep frees native code through `cl_jit_free_native`
  (each backend's own allocator: `platform_free` on m68k, the code heap
  here).
- `cl_jit_shutdown`, called in `main()` after `cl_mem_shutdown` (which
  released every function's code), unmaps the chunks;
  `tests/test_memleak_tracked.sh` has the `no_leak_after_jit_stubs`
  scenario.

## Code layout in the tree

```
src/jit/jit_common.c        hot policy, on/off switches, stats, invoke
                            bookkeeping -- moved out of the m68k walker
src/jit/jit_m68k.c          the m68k walker and its compile driver
src/jit/jit_a64.c           the AArch64 walker and its compile driver
src/jit/asm_a64.{c,h}       encoders + label/fixup
src/jit/codeheap.{c,h}      executable-memory allocator (AArch64 only)
src/jit/runtime.{c,h}       helpers every backend shares (CPU-neutral slow
                            paths: arithmetic, cells, globals, structs, ...)
src/jit/runtime_m68k.{c,h}  the m68k walker's own: its operand stack is the
                            m68k stack (call sites, inline-setjmp NLX frames,
                            the &key prologue, OP_AMIGA_CALL)
src/jit/runtime_vmstack.{c,h}  a walker whose frame lives in cl_vm.stack
                            (cl_jit_vmstack_*: calls, tail calls, CONS/LIST)
```

The helpers are split by frame design, not by CPU (after phase 1, before
phase 2): a PPC or x86-64 walker built like the AArch64 one reuses
`runtime.c` and `runtime_vmstack.c` and adds only its walker and encoders.
Phase 0 and 1 below still say `jit.c` -- the m68k walker's name then.

- `jit.h` guards become `#if defined(JIT_M68K) || defined(JIT_A64)`.
- The `Makefile` defines `JIT_A64` when `uname -m` is `arm64`/`aarch64`
  and the system is Darwin or Linux (Linux since phase 4), and adds the
  new files.
- `--no-jit`, `%JIT-SET-ACTIVE`, `%JIT-SET-HOT-THRESHOLD` and the lazy
  policy behave as on m68k.
- `%JIT-DISASSEMBLE` gets a small decoder for the instruction forms
  `asm_a64.c` emits, plus a `.word` fallback, as on m68k.

## Phases

Each phase ends with `make test`, `make test-gc-stress` and
`make test-memleak` green on an arm64 Mac, and on an x86-64 host as
well, where the backend compiles to stubs.  Phase 0 touches `jit.c`,
so it also needs `make -f Makefile.cross test-amiga`.

### Phase 0: split and plumbing
- Move the CPU-independent parts of `jit.c` into `jit_common.c`: the
  hot-call policy (`cl_jit_note_definition`, `cl_jit_note_call`, the
  threshold), the on/off switches and the counters.  The m68k walker
  stays in `jit.c`, which keeps the change to the m68k binary small;
  `test-amiga` decides.  Moving the walker into a file of its own can
  come later, if it ever helps.
- Add `JIT_A64`, `asm_a64.c` with the encoders phase 1 needs, the code
  heap and the platform calls.
- Make `cl_jit_emit_stub` (`%JIT-COMPILE-STUB`) emit and run a `ret`
  stub.
- Tests:
  - `tests/test_asm_a64.c`: every encoder against its known word,
    recorded once from `clang -c` output; the test itself needs no
    assembler.
  - Encoder failure on out-of-range operands.
  - Label fixups, forward and backward, including the out-of-range
    error.
  - On arm64 only, assemble tiny functions and call them.

**Status (2026-10-01): done** on branch `feat/a64-jit`.
- `jit_backend.h` is the seam: `jit_common.c` owns the policy and the
  counters, and each backend supplies `cl_jit_backend_init/_compile/
  _shutdown`, `cl_jit_invoke`, the stub, the disassembler and
  `cl_jit_free_native`.  `cl_jit_invoke` stays per backend: the m68k one
  sets up the conservative-scan window and the C-stack floor, which
  AArch64 does not need.
- `jit_a64.c` declines every function.  `%JIT-COMPILE-STUB` installs
  `mov w0, #0; ret`, OP_CALL enters it, and a redefinition, a restub or
  the sweep frees it.  `%JIT-SET-DIRECT-CALLS` reads NIL (no call sites).
  No boot banner on the host.
- `asm_a64.c` is compiled on every host, so `tests/test_asm_a64.c` (89
  encodings pinned to clang, the `A64_BAD` contract, `a64_mov_imm`, label
  fixups and their failures) runs on x86-64 too.  `make host JIT=0`
  builds an arm64 Mac without the backend.
- Tests: `test_asm_a64.c`, `test_codeheap.c` (execution, reuse,
  splitting, refused frees, an oversize chunk, four threads churning,
  shutdown), `test_jit_a64.sh` (also in `make test-gc-stress`), and the
  `no_leak_after_jit_stubs` memleak scenario.

Done in phase 1:
- `cl_jitc_invoke_count` is a process-wide counter written on every native
  entry.  That is harmless for stubs, but under threads it is the
  shared-cache-line cost the hot-path rule in `CLAUDE.md` forbids; make
  it per-thread (or count only in debug builds) before native code runs
  hot.
- `vm.c` still gates the hot-call counting and the native tail call on
  `JIT_M68K`.  Phase 1 switches them to `CL_JIT_NATIVE`, and since that
  touches `cl_vm_run`, the `vm.*` rows of bench-opt must be compared
  against `docs/benchmarks.md`.

### Phase 1: the walker that cannot be wrong
- Native operand stack, locals, constants from the pool, jumps with the
  backward-branch poll, `OP_RET`, the entry/prologue above, and calls
  through the existing `jit_dispatch` helpers.
- Every other opcode the m68k walker handles is a call to its existing
  runtime helper, or a decline (the function stays interpreted).
- No inline fast paths and no register cache yet.
- Tests:
  - The behavioural sections of `tests/amiga/test-jit.lisp` run on the
    host through a new shell test, with JIT on, eager
    (`%JIT-SET-HOT-THRESHOLD 0`).  The m68k byte goldens are guarded with
    `#+m68k`, and new AArch64 goldens are added for the matcher shapes.
  - The same run under `CLAMIGA_GC_STRESS=1`.
  - The whole `make test` Lisp suite once with eager JIT, as a
    differential run against the interpreter.
  - A threaded test: a call-free native loop in one thread while another
    thread forces GCs, which must finish (Rule 4).

**Status (2026-10-01): done** on branch `feat/a64-jit`.
- `jit_a64.c` walks the bytecode once.  Covered: the stack and local
  opcodes and their superinstructions, constants, every branch (with the
  loop poll at each backward-branch target), `RET`, the calls (`CALL`,
  `CALL_GLOBAL` and its fused heads, `APPLY`), arithmetic and comparisons,
  `EQ`/`NOT`, `CAR`/`CDR`/`CONS`/`LIST`/`RPLACA`/`RPLACD`, the global and
  function cells, struct slots, `ASET`/`AREF`, `ASSERT_TYPE`, and the
  string-scan opcodes.  Each runs the helper the m68k walker calls, or an
  AArch64 one (now `runtime_vmstack.c`) that takes pointers into `cl_vm.stack`
  (`cl_jit_vmstack_*`), and writes `cl_mv_count` where the interpreter
  does.  `EQ`, `NOT` and the branches are inline.  Everything else declines:
  the NLX frames, dynamic binding, `PROGV`, the multiple-value opcodes,
  closures and upvalues, `&key`/`&optional`/`&rest`, handlers and restarts.
- The walker tracks the operand-stack depth; an edge whose depth disagrees
  with its target's declines the function, and the deepest point sizes the
  prologue's overflow check (bytecode carries no max-stack field).
- A self tail call reuses the frame behind a runtime guard
  (`cl_jit_vmstack_is_self`: same bytecode, nothing traced), storing the
  callee as the frame's function.  Any other tail call to a native callee is
  handed to `cl_jit_invoke` (`CL_Thread.jit_tail_pending`): the arguments
  are moved to the frame base and the callee entered from there, so mutual
  tail recursion between native functions runs in constant space, as in the
  interpreter.  A tail call into an interpreted function is still a nested
  call, as on m68k; hot compilation makes such a chain native quickly.
- `vm.c`'s hot-call counting and its tail call into native code are
  switched from `JIT_M68K` to `CL_JIT_NATIVE`; `%JIT-INVOKE-COUNT` counts
  per thread (`CL_Thread.jit_invoke_count`) on AArch64.
- `CLAMIGA_JIT_HOT=N` sets the hot threshold at boot; `make test-jit-eager`
  runs the fast tier with every function compiled at definition.
- Tests: `tests/test_jit_a64_walk.sh` (also under gc-stress) runs the
  behavioural checks of `tests/amiga/test-jit.lisp` eager -- its
  m68k-specific checks are now `#+m68k` -- and this backend's own: the
  covered shapes, bignum/ratio/float slow paths, deep and runaway
  recursion, self and mutual tail calls, errors unwinding through native
  frames, values across collections, redefinition, the multiple-value
  state, native code on four threads, and the loop poll (a call-free native
  loop in one thread while another collects).
- `make test-jit-eager` (the fast tier, every function compiled at
  definition) computes every result the interpreter does.  What fails
  there is introspection only: a native frame is not in the VM's frame
  list unless `%JIT-SET-FRAMES` is on, so the backtrace, line-attribution
  and `FRAME`-locals tests (`test_debugger_backtrace`,
  `test_backtrace_lines`, `test_backtrace_after_handled_error`,
  `test_call_diag`, `test_dev_commands`' frame session, two lines each of
  `test_tier4_phase2/3` and `test_fasl_source_name`) miss the native
  callee's frame -- the m68k JIT's open item too.  Phase 3's shadow frames
  close it.
- No inline fast path yet, but the dispatch is gone: on an M-series Mac
  `trunk/bench-jit-call.lisp` runs every row faster than the interpreter
  (builtin calls and native leaves 2-3x, `case` dispatch 3x, the mixed
  decode-key rows 1.8x; a call into a bytecode leaf or an `&optional` one
  equal), and none slower.  The `vm.*` and `mt.*` rows of `bench-opt`
  (interpreted) are unchanged within 1 ms against phase 0, three
  interleaved pairs.

### Phase 2: inline fast paths and the register cache
Fixnum templates check both operands before touching the stack (taken
from evergreen), so a failed check leaves the frame as the slow path
expects:

```
and  w9, wa, wb  ; tbz w9, #0, slow        ; both fixnums?
add:  sub w9, wb, #1 ; adds wr, wa, w9 ; b.vs slow
sub:  subs wr, wa, wb ; b.vs slow ; add wr, wr, #1
mul:  asr w9, wa, #1 ; sub w10, wb, #1 ; smull x11, w9, w10
      cmp x11, w11, sxtw ; b.ne slow ; orr wr, w11, #1
<,=:  cmp wa, wb ; cset / b.cond            ; tagged order = numeric order
```

Also inline: `EQ`, `NOT`, `CAR`/`CDR` with the type check, `GLOAD`/`GSTORE`
fast paths, `STRUCT_REF`/`STRUCT_SET`.  A 3-slot top-of-stack cache in
w24-w26 removes most `LOAD`/`STORE`/`POP` memory traffic.  Each new
template gets a gc-stress case that forces its slow path, i.e. a non-fixnum
or an allocating helper.

**Status (2026-10-02): done** on branch `feat/a64-jit-p2`.
- Inline: `+ - *` and `< > <= >= =` on fixnums (the templates above;
  `*` is `smull` with a 32-bit fit check, so it covers the whole fixnum
  range, not only the interpreter's 15-bit operands), the fused `CMP_BR`,
  `EQ`/`NOT`, `CAR`/`CDR` (NIL inline, a cons by its header),
  `STRUCT_REF`/`STRUCT_SET` (header type and slot count checked; the store
  keeps the interpreter's publication barrier, a `dmb ish` taken only
  while `cl_thread_count > 1`), and `GLOAD`/`GSTORE` and the fused
  `GLOAD_JNIL`/`GLOAD_EQ_JNIL` while the thread has no dynamic binding
  (`tlv_entry_count == 0`, as in the interpreter's `VM_GLOBAL_VALUE`).
  NIL as the symbol, an unbound value, `*PACKAGE*`'s store, `CHAR=`, `/`
  and every non-fixnum go to the phase-1 helper.  x23 holds
  `cl_arena_base`, loaded in the prologue (the frame is 80 bytes now).
- Each fast path checks its operands before it changes anything, so a
  failed check branches to an out-of-line slow path (after the body) with
  the cache as it was: it moves the operands into w0-w2, flushes, calls
  the helper, reloads the cache from `cl_vm.stack` (a collection may have
  moved what it held), rewrites `cl_mv_count` if the fast path knew it to
  be 1, and rejoins with the result in w0.
- The cache lives in the caller-saved w13-w15, not w24-w26: it is never
  live across a call (Rule 1), so callee-saved registers would only cost
  saves.  Up to three values; a fourth push spills the deepest.  Labels,
  branches and every opcode without a template see an empty cache; a
  return needs no flush.  A helper call with a non-empty cache is a walker
  bug and declines the function.
- `cl_mv_count = 1` is elided while it is known to be 1 already (from one
  such write to the next helper call or label).
- Tests: `tests/test_jit_a64_walk.sh`, phase-2 section (also under
  gc-stress): every template against its slow path -- fixnum boundaries
  for `+ - *` (`most-negative-fixnum * -1`, 46341^2), ratios, floats,
  complex, type errors, NIL/cons/struct/char under `CAR`, out-of-range
  struct slots, special variables global, bound, unbound and `*PACKAGE*`,
  a five-deep expression that spills, the values count, and struct writes
  on four threads -- each with a heap value held in the cache while the
  slow path allocates.  Dropping the cache reload after a slow-path call
  makes the gc-stress binary fail already at boot.  `make test-jit-eager`
  fails exactly the phase-1 introspection set.
- Bench (M-series, bench-opt with the JIT left on, eager): see
  `docs/benchmarks.md`, 2026-10-02.  The stop criterion (1.5x on `vm.*`)
  is met: 3-14x.

### Phase 3: parity with the m68k walker
- NLX frames (`BLOCK`, `CATCH`, `TAGBODY`, `UWPROT`, `HANDLER_CASE`) use
  the same split as m68k: helper `*_alloc`, inline `_setjmp`, helper
  `*_commit`, and `post_longjmp` on the second return.
  - `_setjmp` restores x19-x28, so x20 must be reloaded from `cl_vm.sp`
    at the landing, as after any call.
- Also: dynamic binding, PROGV, multiple values, closures and upvalues,
  `&key` prologues, the string-scan opcodes.
- Target: the m68k walker's opcode list, minus `OP_AMIGA_CALL`.
- Shadow frames (`%JIT-SET-FRAMES`) work unchanged and now show every
  local, since the locals are on the VM stack.

**Status (2026-10-02): done** on branch `feat/a64-jit-p3`.
- The NLX helpers, the value-save stack and the handler/restart bindings
  moved from `runtime_m68k.c` to `runtime_nlx.{c,h}` unchanged (`RESTART_PUSH`
  and the m68k `&key` prologue stay: their arguments are m68k-stack words);
  both walkers call them.  The m68k objects are otherwise the same code.
- The AArch64 walker now takes every opcode of the m68k walker but
  `OP_AMIGA_CALL` and `OP_ARGC` (only `&optional`/`&rest` prologues emit it,
  and those functions still decline): the five NLX frames, `DYNBIND`/
  `DYNUNBIND`, `PROGV_BIND`/`_UNBIND`, `MV_LOAD`/`MV_TO_LIST`/`NTH_VALUE`/
  `MV_SAVE`/`MV_RESTORE`, `CLOSURE`, `UPVAL`, the cell opcodes, the handler
  and restart bindings, and `&key` functions.
  - NLX: `*_alloc` returns `&nlx->buf`, the native code calls `_setjmp` on it
    itself (`blr`), `cbz` to the commit; the longjmp arm calls
    `*_post_longjmp`, reloads x20 from `cl_vm.sp`, pushes what the transfer
    brought and branches to the landing (HANDLER-CASE: to the matched
    clause's `OP_JMP` in the table).  The walker's depth check covers the
    landings: each gets the push's depth plus the arm's value.
  - `UPVAL`, `CELL_REF` and `CELL_SET_LOCAL` are inline and use the cache;
    the closure template and `RESTART_PUSH`'s name are passed as addresses
    of `bc->constants` words and read after the allocation
    (`cl_jit_vmstack_make_closure`, `_restart_push`), the captures staged on
    the VM stack.
  - `&key`: `cl_jit_vmstack_kw_prologue` runs first and builds the whole
    frame (the keyword pairs sit where the other locals go), with the
    interpreter's matcher and errors.  A self tail call stays off for `&key`.
- Frames: `cl_jit_invoke` pushes the native function's `CL_Frame` (bp,
  `n_locals`, the function) and passes it as a fifth entry argument (x25);
  before each helper call the code writes the opcode's ip into it (elided
  while unchanged), as the interpreter does before a call.  So
  `EXT:BACKTRACE`, the call-site diagnostics and `FRAME` see a native frame
  as an interpreted one.  On by default here; `%JIT-SET-FRAMES NIL` turns the
  push off (the ip then goes into a scratch frame).  A native call now
  counts against the 1024 frames and overflows with the interpreter's "Call
  stack overflow".  An arity error raised from the stub frame of a native
  call names the frame under the stub as the caller (`frame_site_brief`).
- Tests: `tests/test_jit_a64_walk.sh` part 3 (also under gc-stress, and once
  more with `CLAMIGA_GENGC=0`): each frame kind both ways through native
  frames with values held across, nested cleanups and a throw from one,
  handler-case/-bind, restarts, special bindings restored by an error and a
  throw, PROGV unbound and `*PACKAGE*`, multiple values, closures over
  locals, upvalues and a template that moves, every `&key` case and error,
  four threads, `FRAME-LOCALS`, and the backtrace lines.  Dropping the
  frame-ip store, the CATCH tag pop, or reading the closure template before
  the allocation (classic collector) each fails it.
- `make test-jit-eager`: the phase-1 introspection set passes now; the only
  remaining differences were the two expectations of this backend's own test
  (frame size, recursion depth).
- Bench (bench-opt, JIT on, eager, medians of three; `docs/benchmarks.md`,
  2026-10-02): phase 2 -> 3, `kw.call-8keys` 58 -> 26 ms, `mt.dynbind-x8`
  34 -> 11, the `clos.slot-value`/`struct.*` rows 2-4x; every other row
  within 2 ms of phase 2.  Frames on or off is within noise.

### Phase 4: Linux arm64
- Memfd double mapping, `JIT_A64` on Linux.
- An `ubuntu-24.04-arm` CI job.

Status (done, 2026-10-02):
- `platform_jit_map` returns two views and the code heap writes only
  through the writable one (see "Executable memory").  The walker needed
  no change: nothing it emits depends on Darwin (x18 is left alone
  anyway, glibc exports `_setjmp`).
- `test_codeheap` checks that both views hold the same bytes and, on
  Linux, that `/proc/self/maps` lists them `r-xs` and `rw-s`: no page is
  ever writable and executable.
- Gates on Linux arm64 (Debian bookworm, `verify/linux-arm64/run.sh`):
  `make test`, `test-jit-eager`, `test-gc-stress`, `test-memleak` 20/20,
  and the `JIT=0` build all pass; the walker test is 102/102.  The same
  gates pass on the arm64 Mac.
- CI: `ubuntu-24.04-arm` added to the host-test matrix.

### Later
- Direct native-to-native calls through call-site cells guarded by
  `cl_call_gen`, as the m68k walker does them (`specs/jit-direct-calls.md`).
  The cell, the miss path and every `cl_call_gen` bump are portable; only
  the hit path is new code.
- `&optional`/`&rest` prologues in the walker, on both CPUs.

## Measuring

Run `trunk/bench-opt.lisp`, `trunk/bench-jit-loop.lisp` and
`trunk/bench-jit-call.lisp`, JIT on vs `--no-jit`, interleaved pairs on
one machine.  Record the results in `docs/benchmarks.md`.

**Success:**
- the loop and arithmetic rows at least 3x the interpreter;
- no call row slower than the interpreter.  The m68k JIT made calls
  slower until `jit_dispatch` was fixed, so this is checked from phase 1
  on.

**Stop:** if phase 2 does not reach 1.5x on the `vm.*` rows of
bench-opt, the backend is not worth its maintenance cost, and it stops
there.

## Open questions

- Is a full minor pass over the pool list cheap enough, or should pools
  of old bytecodes be skipped unless a constant was young at install?
  Measure the minor pause with `ext:%gengc-stats` on the Clamacs host
  frontend before optimizing.
- The m68k walker matches some whole-function patterns (constant return,
  argument passthrough).  Are they worth porting, or does the walker
  output come close enough on AArch64?  Decide from phase 1 disassembly.
