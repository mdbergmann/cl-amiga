;;; arexx.lisp -- ARexx development port for CL-Amiga (AmigaOS / MorphOS)

;;; From an editor macro (CygnusEd, GoldED, ...):

;;;   OPTIONS RESULTS
;;;   OPTIONS FAILAT 21                     /* let us see rc 10 ourselves */
;;;   ADDRESS CLAMIGA 'LOAD Work:src/foo.lisp'

;;;   ELSE DO
;;;       ADDRESS CLAMIGA 'LASTRESULT'      /* rc /= 0 means ARexx dropped */

;;; This file is the TRANSPORT half only: a handler thread that owns the
;;; public message port, hands each command string to EXT.DEV:HANDLE-COMMAND
;;; and ships the reply back.  Every decision about what a command means
;;; lives in lib/dev-commands.lisp, which is portable and host-tested.
;;;
;;; Concurrency: commands run on the handler thread, concurrently with
;;; whatever the REPL is doing.  That is what makes the port answer while
;;; the main thread is busy -- and it means an editor-triggered LOAD and a
;;; REPL-triggered one can compile at the same time.  Drive one at a time.
