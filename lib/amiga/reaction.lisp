;;; amiga/reaction.lisp — ReAction helpers for CL-Amiga
;;;
;;; Loaded via (require "amiga/reaction").
;;;
;;; ReAction (the OS 3.5+/3.2 and MorphOS GUI toolkit) is a set of
;;; BOOPSI class libraries — window.class, gadgets/layout.gadget,
;;; gadgets/button.gadget, ... — driven through intuition.library's
;;; NewObjectA / SetAttrsA / GetAttr / DisposeObject and through object
;;; METHODS.  The generated raw bindings (lib/amiga/raw/classes/,
;;; gadgets/, images/) already provide every class's tags, method IDs and
;;; the few real library functions they export; the toolkit-neutral BOOPSI
;;; half — DoMethod(), NewList(), tag lists from Lisp values, string
;;; literals that live as long as the objects that reference them — is
;;; AMIGA.BOOPSI (lib/amiga/boopsi.lisp), which this package :USEs and
;;; re-exports (DO-METHOD, OBJECT-CLASS, WITH-FOREIGN-POOL, POOL-ALLOC,
;;; POOL-STRING, NEW-LIST, FREE-LIST-NODES, WITH-TAGS, GET-ATTR,
;;; GET-ATTR-POINTER, SET-ATTRS), so amiga.reaction:with-foreign-pool and
;;; amiga.boopsi:with-foreign-pool are one symbol.  What this module adds
;;; is the ReAction-specific part — what a C program gets from
;;; reaction.lib and the RA_* macros:
;;;
;;;   NEW-OBJECT         NewObjectA with a Lisp tag plist — integers,
;;;                      foreign pointers, T/NIL and strings, the strings
;;;                      copied into a WITH-FOREIGN-POOL that outlives the
;;;                      objects
;;;   DISPOSE-OBJECT     intuition's DisposeObject
;;;   SET-GADGET-ATTRS   SetGadgetAttrsA
;;;   OPEN-WINDOW / CLOSE-WINDOW / ICONIFY / HANDLE-INPUT
;;;                      the RA_* macros as functions
;;;   DO-WINDOW-EVENTS   the canonical Wait()/RA_HandleInput event loop,
;;;                      with an optional timeout for unattended runs
;;;   OPEN-REQUESTER     requester.class RM_OPENREQ
;;;
;;; The module itself loads on any system (including the host and an
;;; AmigaOS 3.1 without ReAction): it only depends on exec/dos/utility/
;;; intuition.  AVAILABLE-P tells whether the classes can actually be
;;; opened; the per-class raw modules (amiga/raw/classes/window, ...)
;;; open their class at REQUIRE time and fail with a clear error where
;;; it is missing.
;;;
;;; See examples/amiga/reaction/ for ports of the NDK 3.2 ReAction
;;; examples, and tests/amiga/test-reaction.lisp for the executable
;;; specification of this module.

;; compile-time too: COMPILE-FILE (the host builds the lib/amiga FASLs) must see
;; these packages at read time, not only LOAD.
