;;; amiga/ahi.lisp — ahi.device (AHI) playback for CL-Amiga
;;;
;;; Loaded via (require "amiga/ahi") -- and only then: AHI support is
;;; OPT-IN.  Nothing else in the runtime or the library opens or probes
;;; ahi.device, and AMIGA.AUDIO (audio.device: the Paula channels, chip
;;; RAM samples, the register pokes) stays the default sound module,
;;; independent of this one.  A program that wants AHI asks for it here;
;;; a program on a machine without AHI never notices this module exists.
;;; Both can be loaded in one program -- but AHI's Paula driver takes its
;;; channels through audio.device, so on a Paula machine the two contend
;;; for the four channels when used at the same time.
;;;
;;; AHI is the retargetable audio system of AmigaOS (Martin Blom's
;;; ahi.device, V4 1997 / V6 2005, from Aminet) and a part of MorphOS: it
;;; mixes 8/16-bit mono/stereo sounds at any sample rate from any memory
;;; onto whatever the user configured in its preferences -- Paula, a
;;; sound card, the PPC machines' audio.  Two tiers:
;;;
;;;   * The DEVICE INTERFACE -- OPEN-AHI on a unit, PLAY-SAMPLE,
;;;     QUEUE-SAMPLE, STOP-SAMPLE, PLAYING-P: CMD_WRITE requests on a
;;;     unit the user set up (mode, mixing rate, channels) in the AHI
;;;     preferences.  One sound at a time per handle, non-blocking like
;;;     AMIGA.AUDIO, double-buffered through ahir_Link for gapless
;;;     streaming.  The first thing to reach for.
;;;   * The LOW-LEVEL API -- ALLOC-AUDIO, LOAD-SOUND, PLAY, SET-VOLUME
;;;     ...: AHI's own mixer under the program's control -- several
;;;     sounds on several channels, each with its own rate, volume and
;;;     stereo position, loops -- on an audio mode the program picks
;;;     (BEST-AUDIO-MODE, AUDIO-MODES, AUDIO-MODE-INFO).  From a handle
;;;     opened with :UNIT :NONE, as the AHI autodoc asks: a unit opened
;;;     through the device interface holds the hardware (on Paula the
;;;     whole of it) and AHI_AllocAudioA on it then fails.  Deliberately
;;;     HOOK-FREE: AHI calls SoundFunc / PlayerFunc / RecordFunc hooks
;;;     from interrupt or server context, where a Lisp callback (which
;;;     allocates and may signal) has no business, so none is ever
;;;     installed and everything is driven from the program.
;;;     AHI_KillAudio is not bound at all.
;;;
;;; The device's functions are called library-style through the base
;;; OpenDevice leaves in the request's io_Device: OPEN-AHI stores it in
;;; AMIGA.RAW.AHI:*AHI-BASE*, the generated table's base variable, which
;;; arms every AMIGA.RAW.AHI function until the last handle closes.
;;; Struct fields are the generated accessors of AMIGA.RAW.EXEC (the
;;; IORequest part) and AMIGA.RAW.AHI (AHIRequest, AHISampleInfo) -- no
;;; hand-typed offsets here.
;;;
;;; See tests/amiga/test-ahi.lisp for usage end-to-end and
;;; examples/amiga/audio/ahi-play.lisp for a program.

;; compile-time too: COMPILE-FILE (the host builds the lib/amiga FASLs) must see
;; these packages at read time, not only LOAD.  The raw modules open nothing
;; at load (ahi.device has no OpenLibrary), so requiring them is free of
;; side effects on every platform.
