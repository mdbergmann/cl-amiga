;;; dev-commands.lisp -- the editor-facing command language for CL-Amiga
;;;
;;; Loaded via (require "dev-commands").
;;;
;;; A command is one string in, one reply string plus a return code out:
;;;
;;;   (ext.dev:handle-command "LOAD Work:src/foo.lisp")
;;;   => 10, "Work:src/foo.lisp:3: ERROR: Too many arguments to FOO ...
;;;           1 error(s), 0 warning(s)"
;;;
;;; That signature is the whole point of keeping this file separate from
;;; lib/amiga/arexx.lisp: the ARexx port is only a transport for these
;;; strings, so everything that decides what a command MEANS -- parsing,
;;; error capture, diagnostic rendering -- is plain portable Lisp that runs
;;; and is tested on the host, where there is no ARexx at all.
;;;
;;; See tests/test_dev_commands.sh for the executable specification.

taking frame 0:

  - Errors raised inside the runtime (undefined function, bad arity) are
    captured at signal time, so frame 0 is already the offending form.
  - Conditions signalled by CL:ERROR run their handlers on top of the
    live stack, so frame 0 is OUR handler, in THIS file.

Skipping leading frames from *THIS-FILE* gives the offending user form in
both cases.  LOCATE is false for commands like EVAL where the form came
from a command string and never had a source location to begin with --
reporting the stale file the compiler last stamped would be worse than
reporting none.
