;;; quicklisp-install.lisp — tiny wrapper around lib/quicklisp.lisp
;;;
;;; Just enough to install quicklisp on a fresh CL-Amiga system. After
;;; this finishes, use quicklisp the normal way:
;;;
;;;   (load #P"~/quicklisp/setup.lisp")
;;;   (load "lib/quicklisp-compat.lisp")
;;;
;;; Usage on a fresh system (where ~/quicklisp/ does not yet exist):
;;;
;;;   (require :asdf)
;;;   (load "lib/quicklisp-install.lisp")
;;;   (cl-amiga-ql:install)
;;;
;;; Mechanism: QUICKLISP-QUICKSTART:INSTALL downloads the QL client
;;; into ~/quicklisp/ and finishes by calling (QUICKLISP:SETUP), which
;;; tries to fetch the default dist over the network and fails because
;;; CL-Amiga isn't a registered ql-impl. We catch that error, load
;;; lib/quicklisp-compat.lisp (its IN-PACKAGE forms now resolve, since
;;; the ql-* packages were loaded by ASDF before the failure), and
;;; retry (QUICKLISP:SETUP) — which is idempotent and proceeds with
;;; networking patched in.
