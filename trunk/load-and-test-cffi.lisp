;; Load and test CFFI (the Common Foreign Function Interface) on cl-amiga.
;;
;; cl-amiga ships a CFFI-SYS backend (cffi-clamiga.lisp) built on the FFI
;; package's libffi-based engine (host: dlopen/dlsym + ffi:call-foreign +
;; ffi:make-callback).  This script loads CFFI and exercises the high-level
;; API with a fiveam suite.
;;
;; NB: the *upstream* cffi-tests system is NOT run here — it depends on
;; cffi-grovel, cffi-libffi (struct-by-value), bordeaux-threads and rt, and
;; builds C test libraries via cffi-toolchain, none of which are available on
;; cl-amiga yet.  This suite drives the same public API against libc/libSystem
;; symbols instead, so it runs unattended on the host.  The foreign-call paths
;; are host-only (POSIX dlopen + libffi); on AmigaOS ffi:symbol-pointer returns
;; NIL and the call/callback tests are skipped.
;;
;; Usage (host):
;;   ./build/host/clamiga --heap 256M --load trunk/load-and-test-cffi.lisp
