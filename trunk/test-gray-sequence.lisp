;; Regression test: bulk sequence I/O on Gray streams
;;
;; Verifies that CL:READ-SEQUENCE / CL:WRITE-SEQUENCE dispatch to the GRAY
;; package's STREAM-READ-SEQUENCE / STREAM-WRITE-SEQUENCE generic functions
;; for Gray streams, that the default per-element methods are correct, and
;; that a stream class may override STREAM-READ-SEQUENCE to provide a genuine
;; bulk transfer (the optimisation that lets libraries like chipz fill a
;; buffer in one shot instead of paying per-byte STREAM-READ-BYTE overhead).
;;
;; Native (non-Gray) streams must keep the boot.lisp behaviour.
;;
;; Usage (host):
;;   ./build/host/clamiga --heap 24M --load trunk/test-gray-sequence.lisp
;;
;; Usage (Amiga, from the Amiga shell):
;;   stack 65536
;;   clamiga --heap 24M --load trunk/test-gray-sequence.lisp
