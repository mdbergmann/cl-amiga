;;; load-libs-ql.lisp — make the load-and-test dependencies
;;; resolvable through ASDF, with quicklisp kept entirely on this side.
;;;
;;; The sibling trunk/load-and-test-*.lisp scripts deliberately contain
;;; NO quicklisp references — they only ever call (asdf:load-system ...).
;;; That works because each of them loads THIS file first, and this file:
;;;
;;;   1. probes for quicklisp (~/quicklisp/setup.lisp on host,
;;;      S:quicklisp/setup.lisp on Amiga) and auto-installs it via
;;;      lib/quicklisp-install.lisp when missing;
;;;   2. loads setup.lisp + lib/quicklisp-compat.lisp once, which
;;;      registers quicklisp's dist + local-projects searchers with
;;;      ASDF — that is what lets (asdf:load-system :fiveam) find a
;;;      quicklisp-managed system at all;
;;;   3. defines ENSURE-QL-LIB, which a test script calls for the ONE
;;;      system it tests. It fetches that system from the quicklisp dist
;;;      into the local repo only if it is not there already, then leaves
;;;      the actual load to the script's own (asdf:load-system ...).
;;;
;;; We deliberately do NOT fetch every dependency up front. Each test
;;; script is meant to run from a cold boot (fresh image, and typically a
;;; cleared FASL cache), exercising the compile+load of just its own
;;; library — pre-fetching the others would touch the network for systems
;;; the run never uses. Fetching is idempotent at the local-repo level:
;;; once a release is on disk it is never re-downloaded, so cold-boot
;;; runs stay offline-fast.
;;;
;;; Run paths are relative to the repo root, matching how the scripts
;;; are invoked, e.g.:
;;;
;;;   ./build/host/clamiga --heap 24M --load trunk/load-and-test-5am.lisp
;;;
;;; The CL-Amiga library forks (closer-mop, trivial-cltl2,
;;; introspect-environment, trivial-garbage) need no ENSURE-QL-LIB call —
;;; they are cloned into quicklisp's local-projects tree, so quicklisp's
;;; local-projects searcher resolves them ahead of the dist releases once
;;; setup runs.  The `swank` stub (symlinked by `make install-shims`)
;;; resolves the same way.
