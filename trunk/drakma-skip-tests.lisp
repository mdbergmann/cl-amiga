;; drakma-skip-server-tests.lisp — loaded by load-and-test-drakma.lisp AFTER

;;
;; cl-amiga runs drakma as an HTTP/HTTPS *client* over the usocket cl-amiga
;; backend + cl+ssl.  The tests left running here exercise exactly that and
;; pass reliably: plain HTTP and HTTPS, GET and POST (google.com), streamed
;; responses (STREAM / FORCE-BINARY), cl+ssl certificate verification (the
;; VERIFY.* badssl.com tests), AND — as of 2026-06-12 — the form-POST/PUT
;; tests that stand up a LOCAL hunchentoot server (post/put-x-www-form,
;; post/put-multipart-form).  Hunchentoot now runs as a server over the
;; usocket cl-amiga backend (cl-amiga portability is an in-source #+cl-amiga
;; branch in the hunchentoot/cl-fad/rfc2388 forks).
;;
;; The tests redefined below are flaky for reasons ORTHOGONAL to the
;; client+server-on-cl-amiga goal:
;;
;;   httpbin.org dependency — these assert on httpbin.org responses, but
;;   httpbin rate-limits aggressively (returns 503) and sometimes stalls,
;;   which makes them flaky/hang in unattended runs regardless of cl-amiga.
;;   gzip-content/deflate-content also exercise chipz streaming decode
;;   (now supported, see below) but httpbin remains their real blocker.
;;
;;   external badssl.com TLS connect — verify.wrong.host and verify.expired
;;   each end with a (finishes ... :verify nil) sub-check that needs the
;;   external badssl.com host to complete a real TLS connection; the server
;;   intermittently drops it mid-handshake (SSL-ERROR-SSL "unexpected eof while
;;   reading").  That one form is dropped from each (see the redefinitions near
;;   the bottom); the two cert-rejection (signals error) assertions are kept.
;;
;; NOTE: chipz streaming decompression (drakma's :decode-content t, which wraps
;; the reply in chipz:make-decompressing-stream) IS now supported on cl-amiga
;; via the mdbergmann/chipz fork's #+cl-amiga gray-stream branch, so the
;; google.com gzip-decode tests (get-google-gzip / get-google-gzip-no-close)
;; run here and pass.  Only the httpbin-backed decode tests stay skipped, for
;; the httpbin flakiness above — not for any chipz limitation.
;;
;; Remove the relevant SKIPs (and the underlying support) to re-enable a test.
