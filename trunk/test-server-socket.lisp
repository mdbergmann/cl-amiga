;;;; trunk/test-server-socket.lisp
;;;;
;;;; Integration test for server-side TCP sockets — ext:socket-listen and
;;;; ext:socket-accept, the foundation for a Sly/SLYNK server.  It drives the
;;;; full Lisp stack: listen, accept, and a bidirectional text round-trip over
;;;; the accepted connection (the same shape SLYNK uses).
;;;;
;;;; Run on the host:
;;;;   ./build/host/clamiga --load trunk/test-server-socket.lisp
;;;;
;;;; Requires a TCP stack.  On AmigaOS that means bsdsocket.library
;;;; (Roadshow/AmiTCP/Miami) must be present; the default FS-UAE config has
;;;; none, so this is host-oriented (also runs on a real Amiga, or a
;;;; TCP-enabled emulator).
;;;;
;;;; The exchange is single-threaded on purpose: a loopback connect()
;;;; completes into the listener's accept backlog, so socket-accept returns
;;;; immediately and the whole round-trip is deterministic — no sleeps, no
;;;; cross-thread socket-table races.
