;; Load and test drakma — the full-featured HTTP/HTTPS client — WITH TLS.
;;
;; This is the SSL-enabled counterpart to the other trunk scripts.  Unlike
;; chipi (which sets :drakma-no-ssl and stays on plain HTTP), this script loads
;; drakma together with cl+ssl so the HTTPS path is exercised end to end.  It
;; brings three cl-amiga capabilities together:
;;
;;   - the host FFI engine + CFFI backend (cffi-clamiga),
;;   - cl+ssl loading against the host's OpenSSL — enabled by the :darwin /
;;     :linux + arch features cl-amiga now exposes, which let cl+ssl's
;;     define-foreign-library pick the right library names and locations, and
;;   - the usocket cl-amiga backend (usocket/backend/clamiga.lisp) that maps
;;     usocket onto ext:open-tcp-stream / ext:socket-listen / ext:socket-accept.
;;
;; The upstream drakma test-suite (ASDF system :drakma-test, run via fiveam)
;; makes live requests to google.com / httpbin.org / badssl.com, so it needs
;; network access and is HOST-ONLY: the Amiga/FS-UAE target has no TCP/IP stack
;; in the test harness, so there is no Amiga counterpart to this script.
;;
;; SCOPE: cl-amiga runs drakma as an HTTP/HTTPS *client* over the usocket
;; cl-amiga backend + cl+ssl.  The tests that exercise that — plain HTTP and
;; HTTPS, GET and POST, streamed responses, and cl+ssl certificate
;; verification (the badssl.com VERIFY.* tests) — pass reliably.  Tests that
;; instead need a local hunchentoot SERVER, chipz streaming decompression, or
;; the (flaky, rate-limited) httpbin.org service are skipped with documented
;; reasons; see trunk/drakma-skip-tests.lisp.
