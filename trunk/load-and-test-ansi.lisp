;; load-and-test-ansi.lisp
;;
;; Bootstrap of the ANSI Common Lisp test suite (Paul Dietz / ansi-test).
;; Loads the rt framework + aux + universe + the CONS chapter.
;;
;; Usage (host):
;;   ./build/host/clamiga --heap 96M --load trunk/load-and-test-ansi.lisp
;;
;; Notes
;; - Each load is its own top-level form: (in-package :cl-test) needs to
;;   execute *between* loads, not be batched with them under one let body.
;; - Paths are passed absolute to the ansi-test loaders so compile-and-load's
;;   internal merge against *load-pathname* (= this script under trunk/) doesn't
;;   mis-resolve into ansi-test/trunk/foo.lsp.
