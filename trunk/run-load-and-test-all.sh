# FASL-cache correctness.
#
# These scripts hit two distinct cache hazards. Both are defended here by giving
# each script its own FASL cache directory (CLAMIGA_FASL_CACHE_DIR, honoured by
# make_fasl_cache_path in src/core/builtins_io.c) and invalidating it when the
# clamiga binary changes:
#
#  1. Cross-script *features* poisoning. Scripts deliberately compile the SAME
#     shared library under different *features* (e.g. drakma builds hunchentoot
#     with SSL while load-and-test-hunchentoot pushes :hunchentoot-no-ssl).
#     ASDF's staleness check keys only on source mtime, NOT on *features*, so in
#     a shared cache whichever script runs first wins and the others load FASLs
#     compiled for the wrong feature set (e.g. "No class named SSL-ACCEPTOR").
#     A per-script cache makes every script compile its own deps under its own
#     features — and stays warm across re-runs of that same script.
#
#  2. Stale-binary reuse. The cache is otherwise keyed only by CL_VERSION_STRING
#     + CL_FASL_VERSION; the clamiga binary is rebuilt far more often than the
#     FASL version is bumped (and WIP rebuilds violate that contract by
#     construction), so a fresh binary can silently load bytecode emitted by the
#     previous binary — missing classes, bad CLOS dispatch, SIGSEGV. We
#     fingerprint the binary's contents and wipe the per-script caches whenever
#     it changes; same-binary re-runs stay warm.
#
# --cold wipes each script's cache per-script (below), so the binary guard is a
# no-op there.
