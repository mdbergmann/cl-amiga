;; Load and test chipi (home-automation lib, system "chipi") via ASDF.
;;
;; chipi resolves through ASDF's source registry the same way it does
;; under quicklisp — on the host its .asd is symlinked into ~/common-lisp,
;; so no central-registry push or path hard-coding is needed here.  Like
;; the sibling load-and-test-*.lisp scripts this file contains NO quicklisp
;; references: load-libs-ql.lisp sets up the dist + local-projects searchers
;; (and the :drakma-no-ssl feature cl-amiga needs), ENSURE-QL-LIB fetches
;; each system from the dist on a cold cache, and ASDF does the rest.
;;
;; Usage (host):
;;   ./build/host/clamiga --heap 256M --load trunk/load-and-test-chipi.lisp
;;
;; On Amiga: --heap >= 96M and a large stack (e.g. `stack 800000`).

;; timeout, can stall far longer), so the suite is unsuitable for an
;; unattended run.  Load the test system, drop that one suite from the tree,
;; then run the remainder.
