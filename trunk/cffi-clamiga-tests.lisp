;; cffi-clamiga-tests.lisp — fiveam test suite for the cl-amiga CFFI backend.
;;
;; Loaded by trunk/load-and-test-cffi.lisp AFTER CFFI and FIVEAM are loaded
;; (so the package references below read cleanly).  Exercises the public CFFI
;; API: pointers, typed memory access, foreign strings, defcfun/foreign-funcall,
;; callbacks, and foreign structs.  Foreign-call/callback tests are host-only
;; (POSIX dlopen + libffi) and #-amigaos-guarded.
