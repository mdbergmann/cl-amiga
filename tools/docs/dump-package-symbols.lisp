;;;; dump-package-symbols.lisp
;;;;
;;;; Print the external symbols of CL-Amiga's host-available extension
;;;; packages, one "PACKAGE|SYMBOL" line per export, sorted.  Consumed by
;;;; tools/docs/package-symbols.sh (the `make docs-check` / `make docs-update`
;;;; machinery) to keep docs/*.md symbol lists in sync with the real image.
;;;;
;;;; The AmigaOS-only packages (AMIGA, AMIGA.*) are NOT here — they don't exist
;;;; in the host build; package-symbols.sh parses those from source instead.

;; GRAY only exists once gray-streams is loaded; load it so the dump is
;; deterministic regardless of user init.
