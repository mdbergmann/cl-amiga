# sento Benchmark Results — 0.8 (speed 3)

Point-in-time measurements of the sento actor pipeline on cl-amiga (host)
for the 0.8 cycle — master ahead of the 0.8 version bump — run at
`(optimize (speed 3))` with the same protocol as the 0.4 entry, and,
because every cell came in below 0.4, a same-session A/B against a 0.4
binary built from the v0.4 bump commit.

**Headline: 0.8 was slower than 0.4 on every cell of the matrix, and the
A/B pinned it on the runtime.** The 0.4 binary reproduces its July numbers
today, on the same machine, same sento, same session; the 0.8 binary as
measured on 2026-08-29 was −9% to −27% against it, the async-ask cells
losing the most (~+11–13 µs per message on both dispatchers). GC was not
the cause — the collector's share of wall time is *lower* in 0.8 in every
cell. **Two of three causes were bisected and fixed on 2026-08-30** (a
process-global counter on the call path; an LTO code-generation artifact
in the interpreter loop); the ask cells recovered about half of their gap
(−27% → −13%). The residual is a compiler-layout effect in `cl_vm_run`
that no source-level tweak reached — see "Root causes" below.

Companion documents: [sento-bench-results-0.2.md](sento-bench-results-0.2.md)
records the 0.2 baseline and describes the benchmark itself (N sender
threads flooding one receiver actor whose body increments a counter — the
numbers measure framework message-plumbing overhead, not application work);
[sento-bench-results-0.3.md](sento-bench-results-0.3.md) is the speed 1 vs
speed 3 comparison; [sento-bench-results-0.4.md](sento-bench-results-0.4.md)
is the previous matrix this entry's deltas are computed against;
[benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md) has the TLAB / generational-GC entries and
the interleaved-A/B method note this entry follows.

## Environment

- **Commit**: `5b4bbf6` (`master`; HEAD at run time was `860106e`, a
  README-only commit on top of it). The binary still reports `0.7.0`,
  FASL v31 — the 0.8 bump had not happened yet, so the ASDF cache
  directory is the 0.7 one.
- **A/B binary**: 0.4 built from `cfd2bab` (the v0.4 bump) with the same
  `make host` in a detached worktree; reports `0.4.0`, FASL v23
- **Host**: macOS 26.6.2, arm64 (Apple M3 Ultra) — the 0.4 entry ran on
  macOS 26.5.2
- **Binary**: `build/host/clamiga`, `--heap 192M`, `CLAMIGA_FORCE_SPEED=3`
- **Collector**: generational (host default), TLABs active — both binaries
- **sento**: 3.4.4, local checkout `~/Development/MySources/cl-gserver` at
  `013ab63` (ASDF resolves it ahead of the quicklisp dist's 3.4.2). 3.4.4
  (2026-08-15) replaced blackbird with sento's own future core; both
  binaries ran this version, so the sento change is not in the A/B delta.
- **atomics**: `~/quicklisp/local-projects/atomics` fork. The 0.8 legs ran
  `d6d72d8` (`cas`/`atomic-incf` mapped onto the new `mp:compare-and-swap`
  primitives, PR #26); the 0.4 binary has no such primitives, so its leg
  ran the fork's previous lock-backend commit `2f5c176` via
  `asdf:*central-registry*`. Either way sento only uses `atomics` in
  `router` and `actor-context` — its message box is `queue-locked` — so
  the backend is off the per-message path.
- **Date**: 2026-08-29

## Reproduction

Run with a **cold ASDF cache** so sento and every dependency compile at
speed 3 — cached FASLs bypass the compiler, so without the wipe the forced
speed changes almost nothing. `trunk/sento-bench-matrix.lisp` is the driver
used here: it loads `trunk/load-sento-bench.lisp`, runs the six cells
back-to-back in one session and prints a `CELL ... STATS` line per cell
with `(ext:%gc-time-stats)` / `(ext:%gengc-stats)` deltas and the derived
GC share.

```
rm -rf ~/.cache/common-lisp/cl-amiga-0.7-fasl31     # version-keyed: adjust
CLAMIGA_FORCE_SPEED=3 ./build/host/clamiga --no-userinit --heap 192M \
    --non-interactive --load trunk/sento-bench-matrix.lisp
```

For the A/B leg, check out the old commit in a worktree, `make host`
there, and run the same command from that directory (its own version-keyed
cache directory stays cold). A binary predating `mp:compare-and-swap`
needs the lock-backend `atomics` checkout — point `ATOMICS_DIR` at it and
the driver pushes it onto `asdf:*central-registry*` (the driver prints
which `atomics.asd` and `sento.asd` actually loaded).

Legs ran strictly sequentially on an otherwise idle machine, in this order:
0.8 cold, 0.8 warm repeat, 0.4 cold. The 0.4 leg ran last, after ~10
minutes of sustained all-core load — session drift (benchmarks.md,
2026-07-11) can only have *understated* its lead.

## Reply-mode / dispatcher matrix

Config: `:num-shared-workers 8`, `:load-threads 8`, `:duration 5`,
`:num-iterations 6`. `AVG` is the throughput figure of record (msg/s) from
the cold-cache run; "repeat" is the warm-cache rerun of the same binary;
GC share = total collector time (STW + phases + minors) / cell wall time;
"0.4 doc" is the 0.4 s3 column from sento-bench-results-0.4.md.

| Dispatcher | Reply mode | AVG 0.8 s3 | Dev | repeat | GC share | 0.4 doc | 0.8 vs 0.4 doc |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------: | --: | -----: | -------: | ------: | -------------: |
| **PINNED** | tell       | **169,018** | 5,145 | 164,580 | 1.0% | 188,076 | **−10.1%** |
| PINNED     | ask-s      |  94,165 | 2,077 |  94,307 | 2.6% |  98,564 | −4.5% |
| PINNED     | ask        |  24,256 |   416 |  23,870 | 1.8% |  32,367 | **−25.1%** |
| SHARED     | tell       |  29,491 |   260 |  28,973 | 2.9% |  31,996 | −7.8% |
| SHARED     | ask-s      |  43,513 |   286 |  43,427 | 1.3% |  49,666 | **−12.4%** |
| SHARED     | ask        |  19,191 |   286 |  17,571 | 1.5% |  23,101 | **−16.9%** |

The two 0.8 runs agree within 3% on five cells (shared/ask, the noisiest
cell in every entry of this series, within 9%), so the version-over-version
drop is not run-to-run spread.

## Same-session A/B: 0.8 vs 0.4 binary

Same machine, same session, same sento 3.4.4, both cold-compiled at speed
3. "µs/msg" is `1e6 / AVG`; the last column is the per-message cost the
0.8 runtime adds.

| Cell         | 0.8 AVG | 0.4 AVG (today) | 0.4 doc (July) | 0.8 vs 0.4 | 0.8 µs/msg | 0.4 µs/msg | Δ µs/msg |
| ------------ | ------: | --------------: | -------------: | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: | -------: |
| PINNED tell  | 169,018 | **191,254** | 188,076 | −11.6% |  5.92 |  5.23 |  +0.7 |
| PINNED ask-s |  94,165 | **103,441** |  98,564 |  −9.0% | 10.62 |  9.67 |  +1.0 |
| PINNED ask   |  24,256 |  **33,239** |  32,367 | **−27.0%** | 41.23 | 30.09 | **+11.1** |
| SHARED tell  |  29,491 |  **30,204** |  31,996 |  −2.4% | 33.91 | 33.11 |  +0.8 |
| SHARED ask-s |  43,513 |  **49,673** |  49,666 | −12.4% | 22.98 | 20.13 |  +2.9 |
| SHARED ask   |  19,191 |  **25,466** |  23,101 | **−24.6%** | 52.11 | 39.27 | **+12.8** |

The 0.4 binary lands on its July figures (−6% to +10%, five cells within
5%) — the machine, the OS update, and sento 3.4.4 are all excluded as
explanations. The gap is in the runtime.

GC telemetry for the A/B (pinned/ask, the worst cell): 0.8 ran 148 GCs
(141 minors, 7 compactions, 0.55 s total, 1.8% of wall); 0.4 ran 204
(197 minors, 7 compactions, 0.80 s, 2.6%). Mark/sweep time is zero in
every cell of every leg; worst single stop-the-world pause 7.3 ms (0.8) vs
8.0 ms (0.4) on the pinned cells. 0.8 collects *less* — it simply pushes
fewer messages, so it allocates less.

## Root causes (2026-08-30) and what was done

Three bisects, each driven by a probe that reads the same every time it
runs (±1–2%), so verdicts are clean; the sento cell itself is too noisy
and too slow (3 min/step) to bisect on directly.

1. **`8f9e85f` (Ctrl-C break-in) — a process-global counter on the call
   path.** `VM_POLL_BREAK()` did `++vm_break_poll_ctr` on a `static` at
   every `OP_CALL`/`OP_TAILCALL` and backward `OP_JMP`. Every thread
   therefore wrote the same cache line on every call. An 8-thread call
   loop went from 6.8 ns to 27 ns per call (3.5×), a special-bind loop
   7.5 → 26 ns; single-threaded nothing changed, which is why no existing
   benchmark saw it. **Fixed**: the counter lives in `CL_Thread`
   (`thr->break_poll_ctr`; `cl_vm_run` already holds `thr` in a register).
   8-thread call loop back to 7.5 ns; sento pinned/ask +8–10%, tell/ask‑s
   +3–6%. Not `__thread`: on macOS that is a `tlv_get_addr` call per
   access and left ~3 ns on the table.
2. **`d467727` (FFI stub descriptors) — an LTO code-generation artifact in
   `cl_vm_run`.** After this commit *every* opcode got 15–25% slower
   single-threaded (bench-opt: `vm.local-shuffle` +19%, `vm.fixnum-loop`
   +14%, `vm.call-return` +9%, even the C-builtin `set.*` rows +10%),
   with byte-identical bytecode and no change to any hot handler's source.
   Building the whole program without LTO recovered it; outlining the new
   `OP_CALL` branch or forcing `cl_symbol_value` out of line did nothing.
   `cl_vm_run` is one 40 KB computed-goto function whose register
   allocation is shared by all opcodes, and the link-time code generator
   simply makes different choices for it than the compiler does.
   **Mitigated**: `vm.o` alone is built with `-fno-lto` (Makefile,
   `OBJ_CFLAGS_EXTRA`); the rest of the runtime keeps whole-program LTO
   (measurably better for everything else). Local-shuffle 68 → 61 ms,
   fixnum-loop 62 → 55, call-return 54 → 49 ns per call — the latter two
   now at or under the 0.4 binary.
3. **Also `d467727` — a residual layout effect that survives no-LTO.** With
   `vm.o` built the same way, the commit's parent reads 52 ms on the
   local-shuffle loop, the commit 61 (its `unwind-protect` loop +8%).
   Outlining the added code, `-O2`, `-fno-unroll-loops` change nothing;
   `-fno-inline-functions` makes it far worse. This is left as is: the
   fix is structural (per-opcode handler functions instead of one giant
   `cl_vm_run`), not a tweak. `trunk/bench-opt.lisp` tracks it.

Excluded along the way, each by a controlled experiment: the atomics
backend (lock vs CAS on the same binary: identical), thread creation cost
(equal), condvar hand-off latency (equal, ~4.2 µs per round trip), CLOS
instantiation/dispatch (equal or faster), the bundled `boot.fasl` vs a
speed-3 source compile (equal), sento 3.4.4 (both binaries ran it).

### After the fixes

Same protocol (cold cache, speed 3), commit = the working tree that
became the fix commit; the "0.4" column is the same-session A/B binary.

| Cell         | 0.8 before | 0.8 after | 0.4 (A/B) | after vs 0.4 | before vs 0.4 |
| ------------ | ---------: | --------: | --------: | -----------: | ------------: |
| PINNED tell  | 169,018 | **175,227** | 191,254 |  −8.4% | −11.6% |
| PINNED ask-s |  94,165 |  **97,733** | 103,441 |  −5.5% |  −9.0% |
| PINNED ask   |  24,256 |  **28,976** |  33,239 | **−12.8%** | −27.0% |
| SHARED tell  |  29,491 |  **29,748** |  30,204 |  −1.5% |  −2.4% |
| SHARED ask-s |  43,513 |  **45,849** |  49,673 |  −7.7% | −12.4% |
| SHARED ask   |  19,191 |  **22,302** |  25,466 | **−12.4%** | −24.6% |

Per message on pinned/ask: 41.2 µs → 34.5 µs (0.4: 30.1 µs). The
remaining 4.4 µs is consistent with item 3 above plus the modest
contended-lock and allocation-under-contention differences the component
micro-benchmark shows (lock acquire +21%, cons+struct +50% at 8 threads),
none of which is a single fixable site.

Two regression guards were added so this cannot come back unnoticed:
`trunk/bench-opt.lisp` now has `mt.call-x8` / `mt.dynbind-x8` (the same
VM loops on 8 threads — a shared write on the call path shows as 3–4× the
single-thread `vm.call-return` figure; healthy is within ~1.5×), and
`CLAUDE.md` records both constraints.

## Observations (as measured on 2026-08-29, before the fixes)

- **A runtime regression, concentrated on the async-reply path.** The
  extra per-message cost is ~0.7–1 µs on `tell`/`ask-s` pinned, ~3 µs on
  shared `ask-s`, and **+11–13 µs on `ask`** — nearly the same absolute
  penalty on both dispatchers, which points at what `ask` does that the
  other modes don't: a future per message, completed from the receiver's
  side (lock + condvar + reply delivery), with the sender never waiting on
  it. The plain mailbox handoff (`tell`) is only mildly affected.
- **Not the collector.** GC share is lower in 0.8 than 0.4 in all six
  cells, compaction counts are identical (6–7 per cell), mark/sweep is
  zero, and the worst STW pause is shorter. Whatever got slower is
  mutator-side C on the message path.
- **Not bisected in this run.** 168 commits separate `cfd2bab` from
  `5b4bbf6`; the diff touches `vm.c` (+582 lines), `thread.c`,
  `builtins_thread.c` (per-thread `:stack-size`/`:vm-frames`, worker
  console), `mem.c`, and `package.c`/`symbol.c` (`cl_current_package` made
  per-thread, `7a0bf22`), plus Ctrl-C break-in (`8f9e85f`) and the CAS
  primitives (`5b4bbf6`). No new default-on environment knob or CFLAGS
  change explains it (checked). The pinned/ask cell is the right bisect
  probe: 27% effect against ~2% run-to-run spread, ~31 s per measurement
  after the cold load.
- **Speed 3 is still not the lever** — as in 0.3 and 0.4, the per-message
  path is dominated by C; a bytecode-level change of a few percent cannot
  produce or hide a 25% shift.
- **Cold-load MT soak at speed 3, three times over**: each leg
  cold-compiled sento 3.4.4 and its full dependency stack through the
  peephole at speed 3 and pushed ~10M messages across six heavily
  multi-threaded cells on the generational collector without incident, on
  both binaries.
- SHARED/tell's wall time (50 s for 6×5 s iterations vs ~31 s elsewhere)
  is the same queue-drain overhead the 0.4 entry describes: fire-and-forget
  senders outrun the 8 shared workers and each iteration finishes its
  backlog after the send window closes. It is unchanged across versions
  (50.3 s / 50.2 s / 50.6 s).
